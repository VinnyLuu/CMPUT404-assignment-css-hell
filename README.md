Changes made to gutenberg html files:
Changed html to use gutenberg.css stylesheet
I changed the font style for paragraphs and headers to Apple Chancery, cursive.
I applied a background image of an old yellow paper to make it feel like an old, worn out book.
Headers are now underlined
Images have a black border around it
Paragraphs have margins on the top and bottom to give more seperation
Made the first letter of each paragraph tag be bolded and bigger
