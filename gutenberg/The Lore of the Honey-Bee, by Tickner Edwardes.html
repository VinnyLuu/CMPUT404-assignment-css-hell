ix</span>INTRODUCTION<br>
<span class="GutSmall">THE OLDEST CRAFT UNDER THE SUN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the oldest and prettiest
fables in ancient mythology is that which deals with the origin
of the honey-bee.&nbsp; It was to Melissa and her sister
Amalthea, the beautiful daughters of the King of Crete, that the
god Jupiter was entrusted by his mother Ops, when Saturn, his
father�following his custom of devouring his children at
birth�sought to make the usual meal of this, his latest
offspring.</p>
<p>The story is variously rendered by ancient writers.&nbsp; Some
say that bees already existed in the world, and that Amalthea was
only a goat, whose milk served to nourish the baby-god, in
addition to the honey that Melissa obtained from the wild bees in
the cave where Jupiter lay hidden.&nbsp; Another account has it
that the bees themselves were drawn to his place of concealment
by the noise made by his nurses, who beat continually <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>on brazen pans
to keep the sound of his infant lamentations from the ears of his
ravening sire.&nbsp; Thenceforward the bees took over the charge
of him, bringing him daily rations of honey until he grew up and
was able to hold his own in the Olympian theogony.&nbsp; In
either case Jupiter showed his gratitude towards his preservers
in true celestial fashion.&nbsp; It was a very ancient belief
among the earliest writers that, in the single instance of the
honey-bee, the ordinary male-and-female principle was abrogated,
and that the propagation of the species took place by miraculous
means.&nbsp; In explanation of this, we are told it was a special
gift from Jupiter in acknowledgment of the unique service
rendered him.&nbsp; In one version of the fable, and in the words
of a famous bee-master who wrote in 1657, �Jupiter, for so
great a benefit, bestowed on his nurses for a reward that they
should have young ones, and continue their kind, without wasting
themselves in venery.�&nbsp; In the other, and probably
much older form of the legend, Melissa, the beautiful Princess of
Crete, was herself changed by the god into a bee, with the like
immaculate propensities; and thenceforward the work of collecting
honey for the food of man�that honey which, down to a very
few centuries from the present time, was universally believed to
<a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>be a
miraculous secretion from heaven�was confided to her
descendants.</p>
<p>Apart, however, from the old dim tales of ancient mythology,
where there is a romance to account for all beginnings of the
world and everything upon it, any attempt to trace back the art
of bee-keeping to its earliest inception cannot fail to bring us
to the conclusion that it is inevitably and literally the oldest
craft under the sun.&nbsp; Thousands of years before the Great
Pyramid was built, bee-keeping must have been an established and
traditional occupation of man.&nbsp; It must have been common
knowledge, stamped with the authority of the ages, that a
beehive, besides its toiling multitudes, contained a single large
ruling bee, divine examplar of royalty; for how else would the
bee have been chosen to represent a King in the Egyptian
hieroglyphic symbols?&nbsp; But it is not only within the limit
of historical times, however remote, that evidences of
bee-culture, or at least of man�s use of honey and wax in
his daily life, are to be found or inferred.&nbsp; So far back as
the Bronze Age it is certain that wax was used in casting
ornaments and weapons.&nbsp; A model of the implement was first
made in some material that would perish under heat.&nbsp; This
was imbedded in clay, and the model burnt out, after which the <a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>mould thus
formed was filled with the molten metal.&nbsp; These models, no
doubt, were in many cases carved out of wood; but it is certain
that another and more ductile material was often used.&nbsp;
Bronze ornaments have been found with thumb-marks upon them,
obviously chance impressions on the original model faithfully
reproduced.&nbsp; And the substance of these models could hardly
have been anything else than beeswax.</p>
<p>But speculation on the probable antiquity of bee-keeping need
not stop here.&nbsp; The best authorities estimate that human
life has existed on the earth for perhaps a hundred thousand
years.&nbsp; The earliest traces of man, far back in the twilight
of pal�olithic times, reveal him as a hunting and fighting
animal, in whom the instinct to cultivate the soil or domesticate
the creatures about him had not yet developed.&nbsp; Later on in
the Stone Age�but still in infinitely remote times�it
is evident that he tamed several creatures, such as the ox, the
sheep, and the goat, keeping them in confinement, and killing
them for food as he required it, instead of resorting to the old
ceaseless roaming after wild game.&nbsp; At this time, too, he
took to sowing corn, and even baking or charring some sort of
bread.&nbsp; It must be remembered that if a hundred thousand
years is to be set down as <a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>the limit of man�s life on
the earth, probably the development of other living creatures, as
well as most forms of vegetable life, took place immeasurably
earlier.&nbsp; The chances are that the world of trees and
flowering-plants, in which aboriginal man moved, differed in no
great degree from the world of green things surrounding human
life to-day.&nbsp; It is certain that the apple, pear, raspberry,
blackberry, and plum were common fruits of the country-side in
the later Stone Age, for seeds of all these have been found in
conjunction with neolithic remains.&nbsp; Evidence of the
existence of the beech and elm�the latter a famous
pollen-yielder�has been discovered at a very much earlier
time.&nbsp; All the conditions favourable to insect-life must
have been present in the world ages before man appeared in it;
and insect-life undoubtedly existed then in a high state of
development.&nbsp; It would be as unreasonable, therefore, not to
infer that the honey-bee was ready on the earth with her stores
of sweet-food for man, as that man did not speedily discover that
store, and make it an object of his daily search, just as he went
forth daily to hunt and kill four-footed game.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a great deal of difference between a
chance discovery of a wild-bee�s nest, <a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>as a common
and expected incident in a day�s foraging, and the
systematic preservation and tending of beehives as a source of
daily food.&nbsp; While it is reasonable to assume that the first
men used honey as an article of diet, it is probable that they
were a wandering race, never halting for long in the same
locality, and therefore unlikely to be bee-keepers in the
accepted sense of the word.&nbsp; They depended, no doubt, on the
wild honey-stores which they happened to find in their entourage
for the time being.&nbsp; But the first sign of civilisation must
have been the gradual lessening of this nomadic instinct.&nbsp;
Tribes would come to take permanent possession of districts rich
in the game, as well as the fruits and tubers, necessary for
their daily food.&nbsp; At the same time the haunts of the wild
bees would be discovered, their enemies kept down or driven away,
the places where the swarms pitched annually noted, and thus the
first apiary would have been founded, probably long before any
attempt at cultivation of the soil or domestication of the wild
creatures for food was made.</p>
<p>Biologists generally regard hunting as the oldest human
enterprise under the sun; but, adopting their well-known method
of deductive reasoning, it seems possible to make out a rather
better case <a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>for beemanship in this category.&nbsp; The
prim�val huntsman must have found much difficulty in
bringing down his game, and still more in securing it, when
maimed, but yet capable of eluding final capture.&nbsp; For this
purpose some sort of retrieving animal, fleeter of foot and more
cunning than its master, must have been even more necessary in
prim�val times than it is in the modern days of the
gun.&nbsp; There seems to be no evidence of man indicating the
most elementary civilisation without sure signs also that he had
trained and used some sort of dog to help him in his daily
food-forays.&nbsp; But man must have existed long before
civilisation can be said to have come within age-long distance of
him.&nbsp; In these times, beset with enemies, he must have built
his hut nest-like in some high, impregnable tree, out of reach of
night-prowling foes; and it is scarcely conceivable that the dog
was his companion under these conditions.&nbsp; More probably he
lived, for the most part, on fruits and honey-comb, and such of
the small creatures as he could capture with his naked
hands.&nbsp; Thus, in all likelihood, the first hunter was a
bee-hunter.&nbsp; Eolithic man may have had his own rocky
fastness or clump of hollow trees, where the wild bees
congregated; and with the coming of each summer he may have
followed his swarms through the <a name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>glades of prim�val forests as
zealously as any bee-keeper of the present day.</p>
<p>Speculation of this kind is necessarily far-fetched and
fantastic, and can be but half seriously undertaken with so small
and inconsiderable a creature as the honey-bee.&nbsp; But it is
interesting from one special, and not often adopted, point of
view.&nbsp; There is no more fascinating study than that of the
ancient civilisations of the world.&nbsp; Egypt 10,000 years ago,
Babylon probably still earlier, China that seems to have stopped
at finite perfection in all ways that matter little, ages before
the time of Abraham.&nbsp; But all these are of mushroom growth
compared with the antiquity of bee-civilisation.&nbsp; It is only
a tale of Lilliput, of a microscopic people living and moving on
a mimic stage.&nbsp; Yet, perhaps tens of thousands of years
before man had made fire, or chipped a flint into an axe-head,
these winged nations had evolved a perfect plan of life, and
solved social problems such as are only just beginning to cloud
the horizon of human existence in the twentieth century.&nbsp;
And they, and their intricate communal polity, have not passed
away into dust, as the great human nations of bygone ages have
done, and as those of the present day may be destined to do, for
all we can tell.</p>
<p>Will a time come when we must learn from the <a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>honey-bee
or perish?&nbsp; We have still probably a few thousand years
wherein to think it out, and prepare for it; but unless the world
comes to an end, or human increasing-and-multiplying comes to an
end, one earth will eventually become too small to hold us.&nbsp;
With this thought in mind, a study of the honey-bee and the
arrangements of hive-life, takes on a new interest.&nbsp;
Supposing that the political economy of a beehive may be taken as
a foreshadowing of the ultimate human state, there is no denying
that we get a glimpse into an eminently disquieting state of
things, at least from the masculine point of view.&nbsp; We see
matriarchy triumphant; the females holding supreme control in the
State, and not only initiating all rules of public conduct, but
designing and carrying through all public works.&nbsp; The male
is reduced to the one indispensable office of sex, and even a
single exercise of this is vouchsafed only to a few in a
thousand.&nbsp; But to create the large and permanent army of
workers necessary in a State such as this, and to recruit it
wholly from the females, it became necessary to revise all rules
of life from their very foundation.&nbsp; There must have been a
great renunciation among the bees, male and female alike, when
the resolve was made to leave the whole duty of procreation of
their kind to one <a name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>pair alone of their
number�one pair only out of every thirty thousand or
so�in order that the rest could devote themselves to
ceaseless, sexually unincommoded toil.</p>
<p>This may be imagined as following on a great discovery, an
epoch-making discovery, changing the whole face and future of
bee-life�how, by the nursing and feeding of the young grub
of the female bee, she could be atrophied into a mere, sexless,
over-intellectual labourer, or glorified into a creature lacking,
it is true, all initiative and almost all mental power, but
possessing a body capable of mothering the whole nation.&nbsp;
Here is socialistic political economy carried to its sternest,
most logical conclusions.&nbsp; All is sacrificed for the good of
the State.&nbsp; The individual is nothing: the race is
everything.&nbsp; �Thorough� is the motto of the
honey-bee, and she drives every theory home to its last
notch.&nbsp; Men are pleased to call themselves bee-masters; but
the best of them can do no more than study the ways of their
bees, learn in what directions it is their will to move, and then
try to smooth the way for them.&nbsp; The worker-bees
collectively are the whole brains in the business, and the
bee-keeper is as much the slave of the conditions and systems
they have inaugurated as they are themselves; while the <a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>queen-bee
is the most willing, and, at certain seasons, the most laborious
slave of them all.</p>
<p>It is useless to deny that bee-polity, with its stern
dead-reckoning of ingenuity, its merciless adherence to the
demands of a system perfected through countless ages, has its
unpleasant and even its revolting aspects.&nbsp; Nature is always
wonderful, but not always admirable; and a close study of the
Life within the Hive brings out this truth perhaps more clearly
than with any other form of life, humanity not excepted.&nbsp;
Absolute communism implies incidental cruelty: it is only under a
system of bland political compromise, of neighbourly give and
take, that justice and mercy can ever be yoke-fellows.&nbsp; In
the republic of bees, nothing is allowed to persist that is
harmful or useless to the general good.&nbsp; Every individual in
the hive seems to acquiesce in this common principle�either
by choice or compulsion�from the mother-bee down to the
last lazy drone, born into the brief plenty of waning summer
days.&nbsp; In the height of the honey-flow, the State demands a
storehouse filled to the brim; and every bee keeps herself to the
task unceasingly until death from overwork comes upon her, and
her last load never reaches the hive.&nbsp; If the queen-bee
grows old, or her powers of egg-laying prematurely fail, she is
<a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xx</span>ruthlessly
slaughtered, and her place filled by another specially raised by
the workers to meet this contingency during her lifetime and in
her full view.&nbsp; Drones are bred in plenty, plied with the
richest provender in the hive, and allowed to wanton through
their days of insatiate appetite, so that no young queen may go
forth on her nuptial flight unchallenged.&nbsp; But when the last
princess is happily mated, and safely home again in the warm,
awaiting cluster, every drone is callously done to death, or
driven out of the hive to perish.&nbsp; If hard times threaten,
or the supply of stores is arrested, the old and worn-out members
of the hive are exterminated, breeding is stopped, the unborn
young are torn from their cradle-cells and destroyed, so that
there may be as few mouths as possible to fill in the lean days
to come.&nbsp; The signs of dawning prosperity or adversity are
watched for, and the working population of the hive is either
increased or checked, just as future probabilities seem to
indicate.</p>
<p>But the most bewildering, most uncanny thing of all about this
bee-republic is the fact that, in it, has been successfully
solved the problem of the balance of the sexes.&nbsp; While all
other creatures in the universe bring forth their kind, male and
female, in what seems a haphazard, unpremeditated way, <a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>these
mysterious hive-people cause their queen-mother to give them
either sons or daughters according to the needs of the
community.&nbsp; They lead her to the drone-cells, and she
forthwith deposits eggs that hatch out infallibly as drones; and
in the combs specially made wherein to rear the aborted females,
the workers, the queen is caused to lay eggs that just as
assuredly produce only the worker-bee.</p>
<p>It is the oldest civilisation in the world, this wonderful
commonwealth of the bee-people, and it is not unprofitable to
examine it in the light of ideas which are at present only
flickering up uncertainly on the distant path, but which might
well broaden out some day into general conflagration.&nbsp; It is
conceivable that a time existed when the conditions of bee-life
were very different from those we see to-day.&nbsp; Bees have
drawn together into vast communities, just as men are slowly, but
surely, gathering into cities.&nbsp; A time may come when
individual existence outside the city may be as impracticable for
men, as life has become for separate bee-families away from the
hive; and then there may arise a purely masculine dilemma.&nbsp;
It may be that once the magnificent drone was of real consequence
in domestic affairs.&nbsp; Bee-life may have consisted of
numberless small <a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>families, each with its deep-voiced, ponderous
father-bee, its fruitful mother, and its tribe of youngsters
growing up, and in time setting forth to establish homes for
themselves.&nbsp; There is no reason why each one of the thirty
or forty thousand pinched virgins in a hive should not have
become a fully developed, prolific queen-bee, if only the right
food, in sufficient quantity, had been given her in her larval
state.&nbsp; But the need for the single large community
arose.&nbsp; The system of a single national mother was
instituted.&nbsp; The great renunciation was made, for good or
ill.&nbsp; And then the trouble, from the masculine point of
view, began.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that, strictly speaking, the
honey-bee does not, and never did, possess a sting.&nbsp; What is
commonly known as her sting is really an ovipositor, and it is as
such that it is almost exclusively used by the modern queen-bee
in every hive to-day.&nbsp; But when the first hordes of
worker-bees were brought into the world, reduced by the science
of starvation to little more than sexless sinews and brains, they
seemed to have conceived a terrible revenge on their
ancestors.&nbsp; The useless ovipositor was turned into a weapon
of offence, against which the drone�s magnificent panoply
of sound and fury availed him nothing.&nbsp; Matriarchy was
established at the <a name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>point of the living sword.&nbsp; A
pitiless logic overran everything.&nbsp; Intolerance of all the
bright asides of life�the wine, the dance, the merry talk,
and genial tarryings by the path, beloved of all drones, bee or
human�darkened the day.&nbsp; And the result is only more
honey, a vaster storehouse filled to the brim with
never-to-be-tasted sweets, at a cost unfathomable, when the old
larder would have sufficed for every real need, and life might
still have been merry and leisurely.</p>
<p>It is only a fable, far-fetched, fantastic, as any told to the
Caliph in the �Arabian Nights.�&nbsp; But there,
again, the woman had her way, like the bee-woman before, and some
day she and her kind may get it on a more ambitious scale.&nbsp;
And then�what of the sword that was once a
sewing-needle?</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I<br>
<span class="GutSmall">THE ANCIENTS AND THE HONEY-BEE</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>�While great C�sar hurled War�s
lightnings by high Euphrates, . . . even in that season I,
Virgil, nurtured in sweet Parthenope, went in the ways of lowly
Quiet.��<i>Fourth Book of the Georgics</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in Naples�the
Parthenope of the Ancients�that the �best poem by the
best poet� was written, nearly two thousand years
ago.&nbsp; Essentially an apostle of the Simple Life, the
cultured and courtly Virgil chose to live a quiet rural existence
among his lemon-groves and his bee-hives, when he might have
dwelt in the very focus of honour at the Roman capital; where his
friend and patron, M�cenas, the prime minister of Octavian,
kept open house for all the great in literature and art.</p>
<p>Modern bee-keepers, athirst for the Americanisation of
everything, give little heed nowadays to the writings of one whom
Bacon has called �the <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>chastest poet and royalest that to the
memory of man is known.�&nbsp; And yet, if the question
were asked, What book should first be placed in the hands of the
beginner in apiculture to-day? no wiser choice than this fourth
book of the Georgics could be made.</p>
<p>For Virgil goes direct to the great heart of the matter, which
is the same to-day as it was two thousand years ago.&nbsp; The
bee-keeper must be first of all a bee-lover, or he will never
succeed; and Virgil�s love for his bees shines through his
book from beginning to end.&nbsp; Of course, in a writer so
deeply under the spell of Grecian influences, it is to be
expected that such a work would faithfully reproduce most of the
errors immortalised by Aristotle some three hundred years
before.&nbsp; But these only serve to bring the real value of the
book into stronger relief.&nbsp; Through the rich incrustation of
poetic fancy, and the fragrant mythological garniture, we cannot
fail to see the true bee-lover writing directly out of his own
knowledge, gathered at first hand among his own bees.</p>
<p>Virgil knew, and lovingly recorded, all that eyes and ears
could tell him about bee-life; and it is only within the last two
hundred years or so that any new fact has been added to
Virgil�s store.&nbsp; All the writers on apiculture, from
the earliest times down to the eighteenth century, have done
little else than pass from hand to hand the fantastic errors of
the ancient �bee-fathers,� adding <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>generally still
more fantastic speculations of their own.&nbsp; And until
Schirach got together his little band of patient investigators of
hive-life about a hundred years ago, Virgil�s fourth
Georgic�considered as a practical guide to
bee-keeping�was still very nearly as well-informed and
up-to-date as any.</p>
<p>It is not, however, for its technical worth that the book is
to be recommended to the apiarian tiro of to-day.&nbsp; All that
has become hopelessly old-fashioned with the passing of the
ancient strawskep in the last generation.&nbsp; The intrinsic
value of Virgil�s writings lies in their atmosphere of
poetry and romance, which ought to be held inseparable, now as
ever, from a craft which is probably the most ancient in the
world.&nbsp; Almost alone among country occupations to-day,
bee-keeping can retain much of its entrancing old-world flavour,
and yet live and thrive.&nbsp; But if the modern tendency to make
the usual unlovely transatlantic thing of British honey-farming
is to be checked, nothing will do more to that end than an early
instillation of Virgil�s beautiful philosophy.</p>
<p>Dipping into this fascinating poem�with its delightful
blend of carefully told fact, and rich fancy, and quaint
garnerings from records then extant, but now lost in the
ages�we can reconstruct for ourselves a picture of
Virgil�s country retreat near �sweet
Parthenope,� where he loitered, and mused, and wrought the
faultless hexameters of the Georgics with so much care <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>and labour,
that the work took seven years to accomplish�which is at
the rate of less than a line a day.</p>
<p>Virgil�s house stood, probably, on the wooded slope
above the town of Naples, deep set in orange-groves and
lemon-plantations, and in full view, to the north, of the
snow-pinnacled Apennines, and, southward, of the blue waters of
the Bay.&nbsp; Vesuvius, too, with its eternal menace of grey
smoke, rose dark against the morning sun only a few leagues
onward; and, at its foot, the doomed cities nestled, Pompeii and
Herculaneum, then with still a hundred years of busy life to
run.</p>
<p>Bee-hives in Virgil�s day�as we can gather from
certain ancient Roman bas-reliefs still in existence�were
of a high, peaked, dome pattern, and they were made of stitched
bark, or wattled osiers, as he himself tells us.&nbsp; Many of
the directions he gives as to their situation and surroundings
are still golden rules for every bee-keeper.&nbsp; The
bee-garden, he says, must be sheltered from winds, and placed
where neither sheep nor butting kids may trample down the
flowers.&nbsp; Trees must be near for their cool shade, and to
serve as resting-places when �the new-crowned kings lead
out their earliest swarms in the sweet spring-time.�&nbsp;
He tells us to place our hives near to water, or where a light
rivulet speeds through the grass; and we are to cast into the
water �large pebbles and willow-branches laid cross-wise,
that the bees, <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>when drinking, may have bridges to stand on, and spread
their wings to the summer sun.�</p>
<p>Virgil�s method of hiving a swarm is almost identical
with that followed by old-fashioned beemen to this day.&nbsp; The
hive is to be scoured with crushed balm and honeywort, and then
you are to �make a tinkling round about, and clash the
cymbals of the Mother��that is, of the goddess
Cybele.&nbsp; The bees will forthwith descend, he tells us, and
occupy the prepared nest.&nbsp; When the honey-harvest is taken,
you are first to sprinkle your garments and cleanse your breath
with pure water, and then to approach the hives �holding
forth pursuing smoke in your hand.�&nbsp; And the old-time
bee-man of to-day takes his mug of small-beer as a necessary
rite, and washes himself before handling his hives.</p>
<p>But perhaps the great charm of the fourth Georgic consists,
not in its nearness to truth about bee-life, but in the continual
reference to the beautiful myths, and hardly less attractive
errors, of immemorial times, copied so faithfully by
medi�val writers, but not apt to be heard of by the learner
of to-day unless he reads the old books.</p>
<p>Virgil begins his poem by speaking of �heaven-born
honey, the gift of air,� in allusion to the belief that the
nectar in flowers was not a secretion of the plant itself, but
fell like manna from the skies.&nbsp; He seriously warns his
readers of the disastrous effect of echoes on the denizens of a
hive, and of <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>the hurtful nature of burnt crab-shells; and tells us
that in windy weather bees will carry about little pebbles as
counterpoises, �as ships take in sand-ballast when they
roll deep in the tossing surge.�</p>
<p>He was a firm believer in the Divine origin of bees.&nbsp; To
all the ancients the honey-bee was a perpetual miracle, as much a
sign and token of an omnipotent Will, set in the flowery meadows,
as is the rainbow, to modern pietists, set in the sky.&nbsp;
While all other creatures in the universe were seen to produce
their kind by coition of the sexes, these mysterious winged
people seemed to be exempt from the common law.&nbsp; Virgil,
copying from much older writers, says, �they neither
rejoice in bodily union, nor waste themselves in love�s
languors, nor bring forth their young by pain of birth; but alone
from the leaves and sweet-scented herbage they gather their
children in their mouths, thus sustaining their strength of tiny
citizens.�</p>
<p>Just as marvellous, however�at least to the modern
entomologist�will appear the belief, widespread among the
ancients, and shared by Virgil, that swarms of bees can be
spontaneously generated from the decaying carcass of an ox.&nbsp;
Virgil professes to derive his account of the matter from an old
Egyptian legend, and he gives careful directions to bee-keepers
of what he seems never to doubt is an excellent method for
stocking an <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>apiary.&nbsp; There is a very old translation of the
passage in the fourth book of the Georgics relating to these
self-generated bees, which is worth quoting, if only on account
of its quaint medi�val savour.&nbsp; �First, there is
found a place, small and narrowed for the very use, shut in by a
leetle tiled roof and closed walles, through which the light
comes in askant through four windowes, facing the four pointes of
the compass.&nbsp; Next is found a two-year-old bull-calf, whose
crooked horns bee just beginning to bud; the beast his nose-holes
and breathing are stopped, in spite of his much kicking; and
after he hath been thumped to death, his entrails, bruised as
they bee, melt inside his entire skinne.&nbsp; This done, he is
left in the place afore-prepared, and under his sides are put
bitts of boughes, and thyme, and fresh-plucked rosemarie.&nbsp;
And all this doethe take place at the season when the zephyrs are
first curling the waters, before the meades bee ruddy with their
spring-tide colours, and before the swallow, that leetle
chatterer, doethe hang her nest again the beam.&nbsp; In time,
the warm humour beginneth to ferment inside the soft bones of the
carcase; and wonderful to tell, there appear creatures, footless
at first, but which soon getting unto themselves winges, mingle
together and buzz about, joying more and more in their airy
life.&nbsp; At last, burst they forth, thick as rain-droppes from
a summer cloude, thick as arrowes, the which leave the clanging
stringes <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>when the nimble Parthians make their first battel
onset.�</p>
<p>For a study in the persistence of delusions, this affords us
some very promising material.&nbsp; In the first place, the
generation of bees from putrescent matter is, and must always
have been, an impossibility.&nbsp; If there is one thing that the
honey-bee abhors more than another, it is carrion of any
description.&nbsp; Indeed, putrid odours will often induce a
stock of bees to forsake its hive altogether; so it cannot even
be supposed that bees would venture near the scene of
Virgil�s malodorous experiment, and thus give rise to the
belief that they were nurtured there.&nbsp; But not only was this
practice a recognised and established thing in Virgil�s
time, but entire credence was placed in it throughout the Middle
Ages down, in fact, to so late a time as the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; It is on record that the experiment was carried
through with complete success by a certain Mr. Carew, of Anthony,
in Cornwall, at an even later date still.</p>
<p>The practice, moreover, was of infinitely greater antiquity
than even Virgil supposed.&nbsp; He was probably right in giving
it an Egyptian origin, and this alone may date it back thousands
of years.&nbsp; In Egypt the custom had a curious variant.&nbsp;
The ox was placed underground, with its horns above the surface
of the soil.&nbsp; Then, when the process of generation was
presumed to be complete, the tips <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>of the horns were sawn off, and the
bees are said to have issued from them, as out of two
funnels.</p>
<p>Nearly all the ancient writers, with the exception of
Aristotle, mention the practice in some form or other.&nbsp;
Varro, writing half a century before Virgil, says, �it is
from rotten oxen that are born the sweet bees, the mothers of
honey.�&nbsp; Ovid gives the story of the Egyptian shepherd
Arist�us as enlarged upon by Virgil, and adds some
speculations of his own.&nbsp; He suggests that the soul of the
ox is converted into numberless bee-souls as a punishment to the
ox for his lifelong depredations amongst the flowers and herbage,
the bee being a creature that can only do good to, and cannot
injure, vegetation.</p>
<p>Manifestly, where there is so general, and so widely
independent a corroboration of a story, some explanation must
exist, which will alike bear out the truth and condone, or at
least extenuate, the error.&nbsp; A careful examination of the
various accounts of bee-swarms having been produced from decaying
animal matter reveals one common omission in regard to
them.&nbsp; All the writers are agreed that dense clouds of
bee-like insects are evolved; and speak of these as escaping into
the air and flying off, presumably in the immediate quest of
honey.&nbsp; But no one bears testimony to honey having been
actually gathered by these insects, nor is it recorded that they
were ever induced to take possession of a hive, as ordinary <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>swarms of
bees will readily do.&nbsp; They are spoken of more as enriching
the neighbourhood generally, by augmenting the number of bees
abroad, than as conducing to the well-being of any particular
bee-owner.</p>
<p>Herein, no doubt, is to be found a clue to the whole
mystery.&nbsp; If it was not the honey-bee�the <i>Apis
mellifica</i> of modern naturalists�which was generated
from the entombed body of Virgil�s unfortunate bull-calf,
what other insect, closely resembling a bee, could have been
produced under those conditions?&nbsp; The answer has been
readily given by several naturalists of our own time.&nbsp; There
is a fly, called the drone-fly, which exactly meets the
difficulty.&nbsp; He is so like the ordinary honey-bee that on
one occasion, and that recently, he was mistaken for the genuine
insect by one calling himself a bee-expert, and holding a diploma
officially entitling him to the use of that name.&nbsp; This
drone-fly would have behaved almost exactly as Virgil�s
calf-bred bees are said to have behaved, and according to the
various descriptions of the matter given by other writers living
before and since.&nbsp; He would issue forth in a dense cloud
immediately his natal prison-doors were opened, and he would
comport himself in other ways exactly as enumerated.&nbsp;
Finally, he would beget himself joyously to the open country, as
a swarm of bees would do; and once more the Virgilian theory of
bee-production would meet with its seeming verification.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>But
having gone thus far with the drone-fly, it is difficult to
resist going a little farther.&nbsp; We cannot leave him in the
ignominious company of slaughtered oxen, but must give him his
due of more lordly associations.&nbsp; �Out of the eater
came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth
sweetness.�&nbsp; When Samson went down to Timnath on his
fateful mission of wooing, and saw the carcass by the way beset
with a cloud of insects, we need not cast any doubt on his
genuine belief that they were honey-bees.&nbsp; He propounded his
riddle in all good faith, and the form of it can very well be
explained as a not undue stretch of allowable poetic
privilege.&nbsp; But that the creatures he saw hovering about the
dead lion were really bees, and that Samson actually obtained
honey from the carcass, is not to be accepted without the
exercise of a faith that is undistinguishable from
credulity.&nbsp; Many attempts have been made to explain away the
difficulties of the problem on natural lines, but they are all
alike unconvincing.&nbsp; There is little doubt at this time that
the part of the story dealing with the honey is nothing but a
deft embroidering on the original legend by some later
chronicler; and that the insects which were seen about the dead
lion were really drone-flies generated in the same fashion as
those from Virgil�s ox.</p>
<p>Perhaps no better general idea is to be obtained of the
condition of bee-knowledge among the ancients than from the
writings of Pliny, the <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Elder, who was born in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 23.&nbsp; He, too, deals with the
ox-born bees; but the reader�s interest will centre for the
most part in Pliny�s grave and careful account of the life
and customs of the honey-bee, as commonly accepted among his
contemporaries.&nbsp; Very few indeed of the facts he so
picturesquely details have any real foundation in truth.&nbsp;
Like nearly all the classic writers, he had little more accurate
knowledge of the life within the hive than we have of the bottom
of the Pacific Ocean But he made up for this deficiency, as did
all others of his time, by dipping largely into the stores of his
own fancy as well as those of other people.</p>
<p>His account of the origin and nature of honey is quaintly
pleasant reading.&nbsp; �Honey,� he says, �is
engendered from the air, mostly at the rising of the
constellations, and more especially when Sirius is shining;
never, however, before the rising of the Vergili�, and then
just before daybreak. . . .&nbsp; Whether it is that this liquid
is the sweat of the heavens, or whether a saliva emanating from
the stars, or a juice exuding from the air while purifying
itself�would that it had been, when it comes to us, pure,
limpid, and genuine, as it was when first it took its downward
descent.&nbsp; But, as it is, falling from so vast a height,
attracting corruption in its passage, and tainted by the
exhalations of the earth as it meets them; sucked, too, as it is,
from off the trees and the herbage of <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the fields, and accumulated in the
stomachs of the bees, for they cast it up again through the
mouth; deteriorated besides by the juices of flowers, and then
steeped within the hives and subjected to such repeated
changes:�still, in spite of all this, it affords us by its
flavour a most exquisite pleasure, the result, no doubt, of its
�thereal nature and origin.�</p>
<p>Modern bee-keepers ascribe the varying quality in honey
nowadays to the prevalence of good or bad nectar-producing crops
during the time of its gathering, or to its admixture with that
bane of the apiculturist�the detestable honey-dew.&nbsp;
But Pliny set this down entirely to the influence of the
stars.&nbsp; When certain constellations were in the ascendant,
bad honey resulted, because their exudations were inferior.&nbsp;
Honey collected after the rising of Sirius�the famous
honey-star of all the ancient writers�was invariably of
good quality.&nbsp; But when Sirius ruled the skies in
conjunction with the rising of Venus, Jupiter, or Mercury, honey
was not honey at all, but a sort of heavenly nostrum or
medicament, which not only had the power to cure diseases of the
eyes and bowels, and ameliorate ulcers, but actually could
restore the dead to life.&nbsp; Similar virtues were possessed by
honey gathered after the appearance of a rainbow,
provided�as Pliny is careful to warn us�that no rain
intervenes between the rainbow and the time of the bees�
foraging.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>On the
life-history of the honey-bee Pliny wrote voluminously.&nbsp; He
tells us of a nation of industrious creatures ruled over by a
king, distinguished by a white spot on his forehead like a
diadem.&nbsp; These king-bees were of three sorts�red,
black, and mottled; but the red were superior to all the
rest.&nbsp; He appears to accept, though guardedly, the old
legend that sexual intercourse among bees was divinely abrogated
in favour of a system of procreation originating in the
flowers.&nbsp; He mentions a current belief�which must have
been the boldest of heresies at the time�that the king-bee
is the only male, all the rest being females.&nbsp; The existence
of the drones he explains away very ingeniously.&nbsp;
�They would seem,� he says, �to be a kind of
imperfect bee, formed the very last of all; the expiring effort,
as it were, of worn-out and exhausted old age, a late and tardy
offspring.�</p>
<p>The discipline in the hives was, according to Pliny, a very
rigid affair.&nbsp; Early in the morning the whole population was
awakened by one bee sounding a clarion.&nbsp; The day�s
work was carried through on strict military lines, and at evening
the king�s bugler was again to be observed flying about the
hive, uttering the same shrill fanfaronade by which the colony
was roused at daybreak.&nbsp; After this note was heard, all work
ceased for the day, and the hive became immediately silent.</p>
<p>His book abounds in curious details as to <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>hive-life.&nbsp; When foraging bees are overtaken in
their expeditions by nightfall, they place themselves on their
backs on the ground, to protect their wings from the dew, thus
lying and watching until the first sign of dawn, when they return
to the colony.&nbsp; At swarming-time, the king-bee does not fly,
but is carried out by his attendants.&nbsp; Pliny warns intending
bee-keepers not to place their hives within sound of an echo,
this being very injurious to the bees; but, he adds, the clapping
of hands and tinkling of brass afford bees especial
delight.&nbsp; He ascribes to them an astonishing longevity, some
living as long as seven years.&nbsp; But the hives must be placed
out of the reach of frogs, who, it seems, were fond of breathing
into hives, this causing great mortality among its
occupants.&nbsp; When bees need artificial food, they are to be
supplied with raisins or dried figs beaten to a pulp, carded wool
steeped in wine, hydromel, or the raw flesh of poultry.&nbsp;
Wax, Pliny says, is best clarified by first boiling it in
sea-water, and then drying it in the light of the moon, for
whiteness.&nbsp; And in taking honey from the hives, a person
must be well washed and clean.&nbsp; Malefactors are cautioned
against approaching a hive of bees at any time.&nbsp; Bees, he
assures us, have a particular aversion to a thief.</p>
<p>To the latter-day practical bee-keeper, all these minute
details given by the classic writers read very like useless and
cumbersome nonsense; and <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>it seems matter for wonder that the
bees contrived to exist at all under such ingeniously complicated
mismanagement, born, as it was, of an ignorance flawed by
scarcely a single ascertained fact.&nbsp; But the truth stands
out pretty clearly that bee-keeping two thousand years ago was
really a very large and important industry.&nbsp; One apiary is
mentioned by Varro as yielding five thousand pounds of honey
yearly, while the annual produce of another brought in a sum of
ten thousand sesterces.&nbsp; Pliny mentions the islands of Crete
and Cyprus, and the coast-country of Africa, as producing honey
in great abundance.&nbsp; Sicily was famous for the good quality
of its beeswax, but Corsica seems to have been one of the main
sources of this.&nbsp; When the island was subject to the Romans,
it is said that a tribute of two hundred thousand pounds�
weight of wax was yearly exacted from it.&nbsp; This, however, is
such an astounding figure that it must be taken with a certain
caution.</p>
<p>Evidently the bees in the ancient world managed their business
in fairly good fashion, in spite of the ignorance of their
masters, or at least of the ancient chroniclers <i>de re
rustica</i>.&nbsp; But it should always be borne in mind that the
writers on husbandry and kindred subjects were seldom practical
men.&nbsp; With the single exception, perhaps, of Virgil�s
�Georgicon,� these old books relating to apiculture
bear unmistakable evidence of being, for the most part, merely
compilations from writings still more <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>ancient, or heterogeneous gatherings
together of hearsays <i>and</i> current fables of the time.&nbsp;
It is certain that the men who were actually engaged in the craft
of bee-keeping, and who knew most about it, wrote nothing at
all.&nbsp; Probably they concerned themselves very little with
the myths and fables of bee-craft, and owed their success to
hard, practical, everyday experience, which is the surest, and
perhaps the only, guide to-day.</p>

18</span>CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="GutSmall">THE ISLE OF HONEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we are to accept all that the
old Roman historians have put on record to the glory of their
race, we must believe that their conquering legions found
everywhere barbarism, and left in its place the seeds of a high
civilisation�high, at least, in the general acceptance of
the word in those lurid, moving days.</p>
<p>But it may well be questioned whether the Britain that
C�sar first knew was as barbaric as it has been
painted.&nbsp; We are accustomed to look upon C�sar�s
account of his earliest view of Albion�of Eilanban, the
White Island, as the Britons themselves called it�as the
first glance vouchsafed to us into the history of our own
land.&nbsp; But this is very far from being the truth.&nbsp;
British history begins with the record of the first voyage of the
Phoenicians, who, adventuring farther than any other of their
intrepid race, chanced upon the Scilly Isles and the neighbouring
coast of Cornwall, and thence brought back their first cargo of
tin.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>And how
long ago this is who shall say?&nbsp; The whereabouts of the
Phoenician Barat-Anac, the Country of Tin, remained a secret
probably for ages, jealously guarded by these ancient mariners,
the first true seamen that the world had ever known.&nbsp; They
were expert navigators, venturing enormous distances oversea,
even in King Solomon�s time; and that was a thousand years
before the advent of C�sar.&nbsp; In all likelihood they
had been in frequent communication with the Britons centuries
before the Greeks took to searching for this wonderful
tin-bearing land, and still longer before the name Barat-Anac
became corrupted into the Britannia of the Romans.&nbsp; And it
is hardly to be supposed that a people of so ancient a
civilisation, and of so great a repute in the sciences and
refinements of life, as the Phoenicians�a people from whom
the early Greeks themselves had learned the art and practice of
letters�could remain in touch, century after century, with
a nation like the Britons without affecting in them enormous
improvement and development in every way that would appeal to so
high-mettled and competent a race.</p>
<p>For high-mettled and capable the Britons were even in those
old, dim, far-off days.&nbsp; C�sar�s account of
them, read between the lines, accords ill with the commonly
accepted notion of a horde of savages, pigging together in reed
hovels, and daubing their naked bodies blue to strike terror <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>into the
equally savage minds of their island adversaries.&nbsp; We get a
glimpse of a people much farther advanced in the arts of peace
and war.&nbsp; In all probability they clothed themselves at
ordinary times, picturesquely enough, in the furs of the wild
animals, with which the island abounded; and it was only in
war-time that they stripped and painted.&nbsp; Old prints have
familiarised us with the sight of the sailors of Drake and Nelson
stripped much in the same way; and the blue paint of Druidical
times is not divided by so great a gulf as the ages warrant from
the scarlet cloth and glittering brass-ware of nineteenth-century
fighting-men.&nbsp; As armourers the ancient Britons must have
been not immeasurably inferior to the Romans, and we are told
that they excelled in at least one difficult craft, the making of
all sorts of basket-ware.</p>
<p>But there is other testimony, apart from C�sar�s,
in favour of the view that they were by no means a barbarous
people.&nbsp; Diodorus Siculus, who was C�sar�s
contemporary, speaks of them as possessing an integrity of
character even superior to that commonly obtaining among the
Romans; and Tacitus, writing about a century later, ascribes to
them great alertness of apprehension, as well as high mental
capacity.&nbsp; Protected as they were by the sea, it is probable
that war entered to no large extent into their lives, and they
were essentially a pastoral people.&nbsp; The cultured and daring
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Phoenician
traders are certain to have prospected the coast much farther
eastward than is recorded, and thus to have materially hastened
British advance in civilisation�at least, as far as the
southern tribes were concerned.</p>
<p>It has been claimed�on what evidence it is difficult to
determine�that the Romans, besides teaching the Britons all
other arts of manufacture and husbandry, introduced the practice
of bee-culture into the conquered isles.&nbsp; But Pliny, giving
an account of the voyages of Pytheas, which are supposed to have
been undertaken some three hundred years before C�sar ever
set foot here, mentions the Geographer of Marseilles as landing
in Britain, and finding the people brewing a drink from wheat and
honey.&nbsp; There is, however, another source of testimony on
this point, of infinitely greater antiquity than any yet
enumerated.&nbsp; Long before the Phoenician sailors discovered
their tin-country, there were bards in Eilenban�the White
Island�hymning the prowess of their Celtic heroes and the
traditional doings of their race.&nbsp; These old wild songs were
handed down from singer to singer through the ages, and many of
them, still extant among the records of the Welsh bards, must be
of unfathomable antiquity.&nbsp; These profess to describe the
state of Britain from the very earliest beginnings of the human
race.&nbsp; And in some of them, which are seemingly among the
oldest, Britain is called the Isle of Honey, because <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of the
abundance of wild bees everywhere in the prim�val
woods.&nbsp; There would be little profit, and no little folly,
in seeking to invest these old traditions with any more than
their due significance.&nbsp; But there is much in a name.&nbsp;
And it may be conjectured that if Britain was known among the
early Druidical bards as the Isle of Honey the natural conditions
giving rise to the name were still prevalent, and reflected
immemorially in the life of the people, when C�sar first
saw them crowding the white cliffs above him, a huge-limbed,
ruddy-locked, war-like race.&nbsp; He records that they possessed
their herds of tame cattle and their cultivated fields; and it is
reasonable to suppose that the hives of wattled osier that Virgil
wrote of a century later had their ancient counterpart of woven
basket hives in the British villages of the day.</p>
<p>No doubt the Romans, during their second and permanent
occupation, which did not take place until a hundred years after,
taught the Britons their own methods of bee-management, and
improved in numberless ways on the practice of the craft, which,
among the British, was probably a very simple and rough-and-ready
affair.&nbsp; But it was not until the Romans had gone, and the
Anglo-Saxon rule was fairly established in the Island, that
bee-keeping seems to have become one of the recognised national
industries.&nbsp; The records bearing on the social life of the
people at <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>that time are necessarily broken and scanty; but it is
certain that honey, with its products, had become an important
article of diet among all classes, high and low.&nbsp; It is
difficult�here in the present time, when cane and
beet-sugar, and even chemical sweetening agents, are in constant
and universal use�to realise that, from the remotest times
down to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there was
practically no other sweet-food of any description, except honey,
in the world; and to estimate, therefore, what a prominent place
in the industries of each country bee-keeping must then have
occupied.&nbsp; There was nothing else but honey for all
purposes, and it is constantly mentioned in the old monkish
chronicles and the curious manuscript cookery-books that have
survived from the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>It is true that the sugar-cane was known as far back as the
first century <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>&nbsp; Strabo,
writing just before the commencement of the Christian Era,
relates how Nearchus, who was Admiral of the Fleet to Alexander
the Great, made an important voyage of discovery in the Indian
Ocean, and brought back news of the wonderful
�honey-bearing reed,� which he found in use among the
natives of India.&nbsp; There is a record that the Spaniards
brought the sugar-cane from the East, and planted it in Madeira
early in the fifteenth century.&nbsp; Thence its cultivation
spread to the West Indies and South America, during that and <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>the following
century.&nbsp; Throughout the Middle Ages it was in very
restricted use among the richest and noblest families in Europe,
Venice being then the centre of its distribution.&nbsp; But
cane-sugar was little else than a costly luxury of diet, or a
vehicle in medicine, even among the highest in the land, until
well into the seventeenth century, when it slowly began to oust
honey from the popular favour.&nbsp; The chances are, however,
that the middle and lower classes of England possessed, and could
afford, no other sweetening agent but honey, for any purpose,
down to about three hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Among the Anglo-Saxons the beehives supplied the whole nation,
from the King down to the poorest serf, not only with an
important part of their food, but with drink and light as
well.&nbsp; We read of mead being served at all the royal
banquets, and in common use in every monastery.&nbsp; Even in
those far-off days there were wayside taverns where drink was
retailed; and the chief potion was mead, although a kind of ale
was also brewed.&nbsp; No priest was allowed to enter these
hostelries, but this could scarcely have been a great
deprivation, as the home allowance of mead was a sufficiently
generous one.&nbsp; Ethelwold�s allowance to each
half-dozen of his monks at dinner was a sextarium of mead, which,
in modern measure, would be probably several gallons.</p>
<p>There were three kinds of liquor brewed from <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>honey in
Anglo-Saxon times.&nbsp; The commonest, or mead proper, which may
be taken as the usual drink of the masses, was made by steeping
in water the crushed refuse of the combs after the honey had been
pressed from them.&nbsp; This would be strained and set aside in
earthen vessels until it fermented and became mead.&nbsp; And the
longer it was kept, the more potent grew the liquor.&nbsp;
Another kind, made from honey, water, and the juice of
mulberries, was called Morat; and this, presumably, was the
beverage of the more well-to-do.&nbsp; A third concoction, known
as Pigment, was brewed from the purest honey, flavoured with
spices of different sorts, and received an additional lacing of
some kind of wine.&nbsp; Probably this was the mead served at the
royal table.&nbsp; The office of King�s Cup-bearer could
have been no sinecure in those days, for it was the custom of
Anglo-Saxon monarchs to entertain their courtiers at four
banquets daily, and the quantities of liquor which the old
records tell us were consumed on these occasions seem incredible,
even in the annals of such a deep-drinking race.&nbsp; Not the
least valuable outcome of the Norman Conquest, as far as the
national temperance was concerned, must have been the reform
instituted in these Court orgies by William the First, who
reduced their number to a single state banquet daily.</p>
<p>If it may be supposed that the reign of Harold marked the
summit of popularity for our good old <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>English honey-brew, it is equally
certain that with the coming of the Normans began its slow
decline in the national estimation.&nbsp; Following in the trail
of Duke William�s nondescript army came the traders, with
their outlandish liquors from the grape; and wine must soon have
taken the place of the Saxon mead, first among the foreign
nobles, and later among the native thanes.&nbsp; From that day
mead has steadily declined in vogue, and to-day mead-making is
practically a lost art, surviving only among a few old-fashioned
folk here and there in remote country places.</p>
<p>But it is still to be obtained; and those of us who have had
the good fortune to taste good old mead, well matured in the
wood, are sure to feel a regret that no determined effort is
being made to rehabilitate it in the national favour.&nbsp;
Perhaps there is no more wholesome drink in the world, and
certainly none requiring less technical skill in the
making.&nbsp; All the ancient books on bee-keeping give receipts
for its manufacture, differing only in the variety of foreign
ingredients added for its improvement, or, as we prefer to
believe, to its degradation.&nbsp; For the finest mead can be
brewed from pure honey and water alone, and any addition of
spices or other matter serves only to destroy its unique
flavour.&nbsp; Some of the sixteenth and seventeenth century
bee-masters were renowned in their day for their mead-brewing;
and one of the foremost of them claims for his potion <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>that it was
absolutely indistinguishable, by the most competent judges, from
old Canary Sack.&nbsp; He gives careful directions for the
manufacture of his mead; and these can be, and have, indeed,
recently been, followed with complete success.&nbsp; This mead,
when kept for a number of years, froths into the glass like
champagne, but stills at once, leaving the glass lined with
sparkling air-bells.&nbsp; It is of a pale golden colour, and has
a bouquet something like old cider; but its flavour is hardly to
be compared with any known liquor of the present time.&nbsp; It
is interesting, however, to have its originator�s authority
for its close resemblance to Canary Sack, as this gives a clue to
the intrinsic qualities of a wine long since passed out of the
popular ken.</p>

28</span>CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="GutSmall">BEE-MASTERS IN THE MIDDLE AGES</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Students</span> of old books on the
honey-bee are generally struck with two very remarkable
characteristics about them�their invariable fine old
classic and romantic flavour, and their ingenious leavening of a
great mass of quite obvious fable by a very small modicum of
enduring fact.</p>
<p>It is difficult to realise, until one has delved deep into
these curious old records, how completely they are dyed through
and through with the picturesque, but mainly erroneous, ideas of
the ancient classic bee-fathers.&nbsp; The writers were, almost
without exception, earnest, practical men, whose chief interest
in life was the study and pursuit of their craft.&nbsp; But they
seem, one and all, to have laboured under the idea that it was
their bounden duty to uphold everything written about bees by the
old Greek and Roman <i>litterati</i>, and that it would be the
rankest heresy to advance any new truth, garnered from their
individual experience, unless it could be supported by ample
testimony from the same infallible source.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>They
seemed to look upon the works of Aristotle, Virgil, Pliny, and
the rest, as so many divine revelations of the mystery of
bee-craft, all-sufficing, finitely perfect; and they continually
quoted from them in support of their own contentions, or in
refutation of the statements of others, much as teachers of
religion refer doubters to Bible texts.&nbsp; The bee-masters of
the Middle Ages were, however, not alone in adopting this
peculiar attitude of mind.&nbsp; It seems to have been the
prevailing habit of the time with all classes.&nbsp; One might
almost be justified in concluding that the study of nature in
those days had no other object with these inveterate old
classicians but to support what had already been set down by
their revered oracles.&nbsp; It was enough that a thing had been
written in Greek or Latin in the literary youth of the world; it
was immaculate�the first and last word on the question; and
if their personal observations seemed at variance with any
statement of the old-world writers, then the contradiction was
only an apparent one, and could, no doubt, be easily resolved by
a more learned exponent of these bee-scriptures of ancient
days.</p>
<p>It is certainly, at first glance, a matter for wonder that men
could pass their whole lives in the pursuit of the craft, and yet
manage to preserve uncorrupted a faith which seems so readily,
and at so <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>many points, assailable.&nbsp; But it must be remembered
that any observation of the inner life of the honey-bee was then
an extremely difficult thing.&nbsp; It was next to impossible to
see anything that was going on inside the hives in use at that
day.&nbsp; Pliny mentions a hive made of what he calls
mirror-stone, which was probably talc, and through the
transparent sides of which the working of the bees could be
seen.&nbsp; But nothing of the kind seems to have been attempted
among English bee-masters until the seventeenth century.&nbsp;
Moreover, even if the whole hive had been made of clear glass,
the observer would have been very little the wiser.&nbsp; He
would have had the outer sides of the two end combs in view, and
he would have seen much coming and going among the bees, with an
occasional glimpse of the queen.&nbsp; But all the wonderful
activity of the hive, so laboriously ascertained by latter-day
observers, with the help of so many ingenious appliances, goes on
entirely in the hidden recesses of the combs; and any attempt to
study this life under the conditions appertaining in the Middle
Ages would have been manifestly futile.&nbsp; It was not until
Huber�s leaf-hive was invented�when it became to some
extent possible to divide the combs for a short time without
hopelessly disturbing the bees�that any real progress in
bee-knowledge was made.&nbsp; The modern observation-hive,
wherein the bees are compelled to build their <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>combs between
glass partitions, one over the other instead of side by side, was
a still greater advance, and rendered the whole interior of the
bee-dwelling available for study.&nbsp; But it is open to
objection that bee-life in such a contrivance is carried on under
too artificial conditions.&nbsp; In a natural bee-nest, the combs
are built roughly side by side, and the brood is reared in the
centre area of each comb, the surface covered by the
breeding-cells diminishing outwards in each direction.&nbsp; Thus
the brood-nest takes a globular form, with the honey-stores above
and around it; and this natural arrangement is inevitably
destroyed in a hive where the combs are superimposed and not
collateral.</p>
<p>In the face, therefore, of the practical impossibility of
learning anything about bees when they were housed in the usual
straw-skep, the old bee-masters confined themselves to a
repetition of the beliefs of the ancient writers, deftly
interwoven with speculations of their own, which, as no one was
in a position to refute them, were advanced with all the more
daring and assurance.</p>
<p>They seem to have been, in the main, agreed on the point that
the ordinary generative principle, otherwise universal throughout
creation, was miraculously dispensed with in the single case of
the honey-bee.&nbsp; Moses Rusden, who was bee-master to King
Charles the Second, and who published his �Further
Discovery of Bees� so <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>late as the year 1679, believed that
the worker-bees gathered from the flowers not only the germs of
life, but the actual corporeal substance, of the young bees.</p>
<p>He pointed triumphantly to the little globular lumps of
many-coloured pollen which bees so industriously fetch into the
hives during the breeding-season, and asserted that these were
the actual bodily matter from which the young bees
developed.&nbsp; He also maintained that every hive was ruled
over by a king, but here Rusden was evidently trying to serve two
masters.&nbsp; No doubt he was a true �Abhorrer,� and
heartily detested anything at variance with the doctrine of the
divine right of monarchs.&nbsp; He had faithfully copied from
Virgil as to the gathering of this generative substance from the
flowers; but he felt that, as the King�s Bee-Master, it was
incumbent on him to put in a good word for the restored monarchy
if he could.&nbsp; There were still many in the realm who were
altogether opposed to the Restoration, and probably more who were
waverers between the faiths.&nbsp; And Rusden, doubtless, saw
that if he could point to any parallel instance in Nature where
the system of monarchy was the divinely ordained state, he would
be furnishing his patron with a magnificent argument in favour of
his kingship, and one, moreover, which would especially appeal to
the ignorant and superstitious masses.&nbsp; No doubt, however,
in taking up this position, <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Rusden was only echoing the belief
immemorially established among the beemen of the past.</p>
<p>The single large bee, which all knew to exist in each hive,
was generally looked upon as the absolute ruler of the
community.&nbsp; It is variously described as a king or queen by
writers in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, but only in the
sense of a governor; and the word chosen largely depended on the
sex of the august person who happened to occupy the English
throne at the time.&nbsp; Thus Rusden very wisely discarded the
notion of a queen-bee when he had to deal with Charles the
Second.&nbsp; Butler, perhaps the most learned of the
medi�val writers on the honey-bee, as astutely forbore to
mention the word king, his book being published in the reign of
Queen Anne.&nbsp; He calls it �The Feminine
Monarchie,� but seems to have no more suspected the truth
that the large bee was really the mother of the whole colony than
any of his predecessors.&nbsp; Almost alone in his day, however,
he refuses to accept the flower theory of bee-generation, and
asserts that the worker-bees and drones are the females and males
respectively.&nbsp; But, he says, they �engender not as
other living creatures; onely they suffer their Drones among them
for a season, by whose Masculine virtue they strangely conceive
and breed for the preservation of their sweet kinde.�&nbsp;
He gets over the difficulty of there being no drones in the hive
for nine months in the year, during part of which <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>time breeding
goes actively forward, by asserting that the worker-bees
immaculately conceive of the drones for the season, their summer
impregnation sufficing until the drones reappear in the May of
the following year.&nbsp; Thus, without guessing it, he was very
near the discovery of one of the most astounding facts in
Nature�that the queen-bee of a hive, after a single traffic
with a drone, continues to produce fertile eggs for the rest of
her life, which may extend to as long as three, or even four,
years.</p>
<p>Butler�s book is rich in the quaint bee-lore of his
times.&nbsp; He tells us the queen-bee has under her
�subordinate Gouvernours and Leaders.&nbsp; For difference
from the rest they beare for their crest a tuft or tossel, in
some coloured yellow, in some murrey, in manner of a plume;
whereof some turne downward like an Ostrich-feather, others stand
upright like a Hern-top.&nbsp; In less than a quarter of an
hour,� he assures us, �you may see three or foure of
them come forth of a good stall; but chiefly in Gemini, before
their continuall labour have worne these ornaments.�&nbsp;
And any warm spring or summer morning, if you watch a hive of
bees at work, you may chance upon much the same thing.&nbsp; In
some flowers, notably the evening primrose, the pollen-grains
have a way of clinging together in threads; and these festoons
often catch in the antenn� of the foraging bees, giving
much the same appearance of a plume, or tassel, as Butler saw in
his day.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>He
gives some advice as to the deportment of a good bee-master which
is well worth quoting.&nbsp; �If thou wilt have the favour
of thy Bees that they sting thee not, thou must avoid such things
as offend them: thou must not be unchaste or uncleanely: for
impurity and sluttishnesse (themselves being most chaste and
neat) they utterly abhore: thou must not come among them smelling
of sweat, or having a stinking breath, caused either through
eating of Leekes, Onions, Garleeke, and the like; or by any other
meanes: the noisomenesse whereof is corrected with a cup of
Beere: and therefore it is not good to come among them before you
have drunke: thou must not be given to surfeiting and
drunkennesse: thou must not come puffing and blowing unto them,
neither hastily stir among them, nor violently defend thy selfe
when they seeme to threaten thee; but softly moving thy hand
before thy face, gently putting them by: and lastly, thou must be
no Stranger unto them.&nbsp; In a word, thou must be chaste,
cleanly, sweet, sober, quiet, and familiar: so will they love
thee, and know thee from all other.�&nbsp; Thus, the good
bee-master, according to Butler, is necessarily a compendium of
all the virtues; and nothing more seems to be wanted to bring
about the millennium than to induce all mankind to become keepers
of bees.</p>
<p>Writers on the honey-bee in medi�val times vied with
each other in their testimony to the <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>extraordinary powers and intelligence
of their hive-people.&nbsp; But perhaps a story, gravely related
by Butler, outdoes them all.&nbsp; He prefaces it by declaring
that �Bees are so wise and skilful, as not onely to discrie
a certaine little God amightie, though he came among them in the
likenesse of a Wafer-cake; but also to build him an artificial
chappell.�&nbsp; He goes on to relate that �a
certaine simple woman, having some stals of Bees that yeelded not
unto hir hir desired profit, but did consume and die of the
murraine; made hir mone to an other Woman more simple than hir
selfe; who gave her counsell to get a consecrated Host, and put
it among them.&nbsp; According to whose advice she went to the
priest to receive the host: which when she had done, she kept it
in hir mouth, and being come home againe she took it out, and put
it into one of hir hives.&nbsp; Whereupon the murraine ceased,
and the Honie abounded.&nbsp; The Woman, therefore, lifting up
the Hive at the due time to take out the Honie, saw there (most
strange to be seene) a Chappell built by the Bees, with an altar
in it, the wals adorned by marvellous skill of Architecture, with
windowes conveniently set in their places: also a doore and a
steeple with bells.&nbsp; And the Host being laid upon the altar,
the Bees making a sweet noise, flew around it.�</p>
<p>This story is only paralleled by another, equally ancient,
wherein it is related that some thieves <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>broke into a
church, and stole the silver casket in which the holy wafers were
kept.&nbsp; They found one wafer in the box, and this they hid
under a hive before making off with the more intrinsically
valuable part of their booty.&nbsp; In the night, it seems, the
owner of the hive was awakened by the most ravishing strains of
music, coming at set intervals from the direction of his
bee-garden.&nbsp; He went out with a lantern to ascertain the
cause of it, and discovered it to proceed from the interior of
one of his hives.&nbsp; Full of perturbation at this miracle, he
went and roused the Bishop, and acquainted him with the
extraordinary state of affairs; and the Bishop coming with his
retinue and lifting up the hive, they found that the bees had
taken possession of the consecrated wafer, and placed it in the
upper part of their hive, having first made for it a box of the
whitest wax, an exact replica of the one stolen.&nbsp; And all
around this box there were choirs of bees singing, and keeping
watch over it, as monks do in their chapel.&nbsp; �With
which story,� adds the narrator prophetically, �I
doubt not but some incredulous people will quarrell.�</p>
<p>In their directions for hiving a swarm, the medieval
bee-masters were always quaintly explicit.&nbsp; The dressing of
the skep which was to receive the swarm was a particularly
elaborate process.&nbsp; When the skep was new, you were
recommended to scour it out with a handful of <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>sweet herbs,
such as thyme, marjoram, or hyssop; and this was to be followed
by a second dressing of honey and water, or milk and salt.&nbsp;
But the preparation of an old skep must have been a rather
disgusting affair.&nbsp; You were to put �two or three
handfuls of mault, or pease, or other come in the hive, and let a
Hogge eat thereof.&nbsp; Meanwhile, doe you so turne the Hive,
that the fome or froth, which the Hogge maketh in eating, may goe
all about the Hive.&nbsp; And then wipe the Hive lightlie with a
linnen cloth, and so will the Bees like this Hive better than the
new.�</p>
<p>When the swarm was up, and �busie in their dance,�
you were to �play them a fit of mirth on a Bason,
Warming-pan, or Kettle, to make them more speedily
light.�&nbsp; We are assured that the swarm would fly
faster, or slower, according to the noise made.&nbsp; If the fit
of mirth were in rapid measure, the bees would fly fast and high;
but with a soft leisurely music, they would go slowly, and soon
descend.&nbsp; This curious custom of �ringing the
bees� is undoubtedly of Roman origin; but whether it was
introduced by C�sar�s followers, or those of Claudius
in the first century, or whether the old English bee-masters
themselves derived it from their classic reading, is hard to
determine.&nbsp; It is still to be heard in many country
districts, and its exponents seem to retain all the faith of
their forefathers in its efficacy.&nbsp; Probably, in
medi�val times, when bee-gardens were much <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>more
plentiful than they are now, the custom had at least one
undeniable merit: it proclaimed to the various hive-owners in the
vicinity that a swarm was in the air, and that its rightful owner
was on the alert.&nbsp; In this way, no doubt, dishonest claims
to its possession were largely prevented, or, at least,
discouraged.</p>
<p>The question whether the noise made by ringing has any real
effect on the swarming bees is still not absolutely
decided.&nbsp; With the exception of the old skeppists, not a few
of whom still exist in out-of-the-way rural corners, modern
apiculturists have long discarded the custom as a gross
superstition.&nbsp; But it has recently been suggested that the
din made by old-fashioned bee-keepers when a swarm is up may have
a real use after all.&nbsp; It is conjectured that the cloud of
bees�which at first is nothing but a chaos of flashing
wings, the whole contingent darting and whirling about
indiscriminately over a large area together�is really
dispersing in search of the queen.&nbsp; The suggestion put
forward is that they follow her by ear, as she is supposed to
utter a peculiar piping sound when flying.&nbsp; The din of the
key and pan may, it is said, prevent the bees hearing this note
and following her in her first erratic convolutions, and thus the
swarm is more likely to pitch on a station near home.&nbsp; The
theory is interesting, but hardly tenable.&nbsp; Old popular
observances of this kind are seldom based on even the vaguest
thread <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>of
fact, and it is much more probable that no effect whatever is
produced on the bees by the ringing.</p>
<p>With regard to the right of a bee-keeper to follow his swarm
into a neighbour�s land, it is interesting to have the
assurance of one of these ancient writers that �if they
will not be stayed, but, hasting on still, goe beyond your
bounds; the ancient Law of Christendome permitteth you to pursue
them whithersoever, for the recovery of your owne.�&nbsp;
But, the writer adds, if your swarm goes so fast and so far that
you lose sight and hearing of them, you also lose all right and
property in them.&nbsp; In this case you have no legal
alternative but to leave the bees to whomsoever may first find
them.&nbsp; In view of recent disputes on this matter, wherein
the law laid down appears to have been both vague and arbitrary,
it is useful to be able to point to so ancient an authority in
vindication of the bee-keeper�s rights.</p>
<p>There is hardly any detail in bee-government which had not its
curious observance or superstition in medi�val times.&nbsp;
One and all seemed to believe in the old Virgilian notion that
bees carried about little stones to balance their flight during
windy weather, and some even thought that flowers were carried
about in the same way.&nbsp; Red-coloured clothing was supposed
to be particularly offensive to bees, and one is warned not to
venture near the apiary thus attired.&nbsp; In the hives the old
bees and the young were believed to occupy separate
quarters.&nbsp; In regard to this, it is a well-attested fact
that, during the height of the honey season, the bees found in
the upper stories of a hive are principally young ones who have
not yet flown.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>We are
told that if any of the bees have not returned to the hive at the
end of the day, the queen goes out to find them and show them the
way back.&nbsp; No one need be in any fear of overlooking the
ruler of the hive, because she can be known by her �lofty
pace and countenance expressing Majesty, and she hath a white
spot in her forehead glistering like a Diadem.�</p>
<p>An old writer advises that all the hives should have holes
bored right through them to prevent spider-webs.&nbsp; He was
also of opinion that the bees swarmed because of the
queen�s tyranny, and if she followed them, they put her to
death.&nbsp; He informs us that the drones were honey-bees which
had lost their stings and grown fat.&nbsp; This was a very old
idea, with which the sceptical Butler dealt in the following
fashion: �The general opinion anent the Drone is that he is
made of a honey-bee, that hath lost hir sting; which is even as
likelie as that a dwarfe, having his guts pulled out, should
become a gyant.�&nbsp; But the bee-masters of the Middle
Ages were ever intolerant of other people�s mistaken ideas,
while supporting with the gravest <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>argument and show of learning equally
benighted superstitions of their own.</p>
<p>A little book published in 1656, and called �The Country
Housewife�s Garden,� is interesting, as it was
probably written for cottagers by one almost in the same humble
walk of life, whereas the bee-books generally of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries were, for the most part, the work of
men of considerably higher station.</p>
<p>This book, almost alone of its kind, harbours no fine theories
on bee-keeping, but keeps throughout to rule-of-thumb
methods.&nbsp; The writer, evidently caring little for
speculation as to the origin of bees, but confining his remarks
to practical honey-getting, takes up the following wholesome
position: �Much discanting there is of, and about the
Master Bees, and of their degrees, order, and Government: but the
truth in this point is rather imagined, than demonstrated.&nbsp;
There are some conjectures of it, viz., wee see in the combs
diverse greater houses than the rest, and we commonly hear the
night before they cast, sometimes one Bee, sometimes two or more
Bees, give a lowde and severall sound from the rest, and
sometimes Bees of greater bodies than the common sort: but what
of all this?&nbsp; I leane not on conjectures, but love to set
down that I know to be true, and leave these things to them that
love to divine.�&nbsp; The �greater houses�
here mentioned were, no doubt, the large cells in which the
queens are bred.&nbsp; <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Just before swarming-time, as many as
nine or ten of these are sometimes to be found in one hive.</p>
<p>The same writer has the inevitable ill word against the
drones.&nbsp; These, he says, �are, by all probability and
judgement, an idle kind of bees, and wastefull, which have lost
their stings, and so being as it were gelded, become idle and
great.&nbsp; They hate the bees, and cause them cast the
sooner.�</p>
<p>Never did creature come by so bad a name, and so undeservedly,
as the luckless drone with these old scribes.&nbsp; Another of
them speaks of the drone as �a grosse Hive-Bee without
sting, which hath beene alwaies reputed a greedy lozell (and
therefore hee that is quicke at meat and slow at worke is fitted
with this title): for howsoever he brave it with his round velvet
cap, his side gowne, his full paunch, and his lowd voice; yet he
is but an idle companion, living by the sweat of others�
brows.&nbsp; For he worketh not at all, either at home or abroad,
and yet spendeth as much as two labourers: you shall never finde
his maw without a good drop of the purest nectar.&nbsp; In the
heat of the day he flieth abroad, aloft, and about, and that with
no small noise, as though he would doe some great act: but it is
onely for his pleasure, and to get him a stomach, and then
returns he presently to his cheere.�</p>
<p>But it is among the writings of the old beemen with a taste
for the quack-doctor�s art that <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>some of the quaintest notions are to
be found.&nbsp; We are told that honey, well rubbed into the
scalp night and morning, is a sovereign remedy for baldness, and
if it was mixed with a few dead bees and a little old comb well
pounded, it was still more efficacious.&nbsp; Dead bees, dried
and reduced to a powder, form a principal ingredient in all sorts
of nostrums of the time.&nbsp; This powder, mixed with water and
drunk every morning, is recommended as an unfailing cleanser to
the system.&nbsp; And if the heads of a large number of bees are
collected, burned, and the ashes compounded with a little honey,
it makes an excellent salve for all sorts of eye disorders.</p>
<p>There was a famous preparation called Oxymel, which was in
great vogue in medi�val times.&nbsp; It seems to have been
nothing more than a mixture of honey, water, and vinegar; but it
was accredited with extraordinary virtues.&nbsp; It was an
infallible cure for sciatica, gout, and kindred ailments; and one
writer also tells us that it was �good to gargarize with in
a Squinancy.�</p>
<p>But honey and dead bees were not the only products of the
hives which were pressed into medical service.&nbsp; Wax also was
believed to have exceptional curative powers in all sorts of
human ills.&nbsp; It had the faculty of curing ulcers, and
�if the quantity of a Pease in Wax be swallowed down of
Nurces, it doth dissolve the Milke curdled in the
paps.�&nbsp; It was also used as an embrocation <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>for stiff
joints and aching muscles.&nbsp; The supposed curative value of
beeswax in its natural state, however, was as nothing compared to
its capabilities when distilled.&nbsp; This preparation, known as
Oil of Wax, and famous at the time all the world over, seems to
have come nearer the ideal of a panacea�a
cure-all�than anything else before or since.&nbsp; The
making of Oil of Wax seems to have been a very complicated
affair.&nbsp; First the wax had to be melted, poured into sweet
wine, and wrung out in the hands.&nbsp; This was done seven
times, using fresh wine at each operation.&nbsp; Then the wax was
placed in a retort with a quantity of red-brick powder, and
carefully distilled.&nbsp; A yellow oil came over into the
receiver, and this was distilled a second time, when the
�Coelestiall or Divine medicine� was ready.&nbsp;
Miraculous portents seem to have accompanied its preparation, for
we are told that �in the coming forth of this Oile there
appeareth in the Receiver the foure Elements, the Fire, the Aire,
the Water, and the Earth, right marvellous to see.�</p>
<p>The power to stop immediately the falling out of the hair,
heal the most serious wounds in a few days, and cure toothache
and pains in the back, can be reckoned only among its minor
virtues.&nbsp; Much greater properties were claimed for Oil of
Wax, for it not only �killeth worms and cureth palsy and
distempered spleens, but it bringeth forth the dead or living
child.�</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>One
last extract must be given from the same old writer.&nbsp; It
relates to the generation of bees, and brings us out, perhaps, on
the highest pinnacle of the marvellous.&nbsp; After a learned
dissertation on the method of breeding bees from a dead
ox�assuring us, however, that if we can procure a dead lion
for the purpose, it will be much better, as then the bees will
have a lion-like courage�the writer goes on to explain how
bees may be produced in another way.&nbsp; We are to save all
dead bees, burn them, sprinkle the ashes with wine, and then
leave them exposed to the sun in a warm place.&nbsp; In a little
while, we are told, all the bees so treated will come to life
again, and we shall then have a new stock ready for hiving.</p>
<p>Dipping into these time-worn records of the Middle Ages, with
their embrowned, scarce legible type and their antiquated
phraseology, one comes at last to realise how very little the old
bee-masters actually understood of the true ways of the
honey-bee, or, indeed, of any real essential in bee-craft.&nbsp;
And yet the production of honey and wax must have been an
industry very largely developed in those days.&nbsp; Somehow or
other, in spite of archaic theories and useless interference in
the work of their hives, these people must have contrived to
supply a market of whose magnitude we can nowadays form little
conception.&nbsp; The trade in wax alone must have been a very
large one, for, except in the poorest tenements, this formed the
only <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>available source of artificial light.&nbsp; And honey
was in much more universal demand than it is now, because
cane-sugar could hardly have developed into a serious rival as a
sweetening agent among the masses at a time when it stood,
perhaps, at two shillings a pound.</p>
<p>But in speculations of this kind, it must be borne in mind
that, although the men who wrote about bees displayed so
picturesque an ignorance in all matters appertaining to their
charges, these formed a very small minority among the bee-keepers
as a whole.&nbsp; Probably the bulk of the supply in honey and
wax came from bee-gardens, whose owners neither knew nor cared
anything about books, and were concerned only in the practical
side of the work, where their knowledge, hereditary for the most
part, amply sufficed for the part they played in it.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is only in latter-day, scientific apiculture that
the work of the bee-master counts to any great extent.&nbsp;
Nowadays, under the light of twentieth-century knowledge, this is
competent to bring about the doubling, and even trebling, of the
honey-harvest possible under the ancient methods.&nbsp; But the
old skeppists did, and could do, little more than look on at the
work of their bees, and here and there put a scarce availing hand
to it.&nbsp; Nearly all the credit for the results achieved in
those days must be given to the bees themselves, who, untold ages
before, had brought to finite perfection <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>their
remarkable systems and policies.&nbsp; In all likelihood the
bee-masters, the practical men who owned the hives, had much the
same shrewd faculty of leaving things alone in far-off times as
we observe among the skeppists of the last generation.&nbsp; In
many ways, what they did at last come to do they did ill, notably
in the apparently insane practice of destroying the bees to
obtain the honey.&nbsp; But even this was not so foolish a
procedure as it appears to-day.&nbsp; It was a plain matter of
business, according to the lights of the time.&nbsp; Their
process was to condemn to the sulphur-pit all the lightest and
the heaviest of their stocks.&nbsp; Experience taught them that
the weak colonies stood little chance of getting through the
winter unless they were artificially fed; while if the bees of
the large colonies were preserved, after being robbed of their
stores, they would need the same provision.&nbsp; It was a matter
of arithmetic.&nbsp; Artificial feeding was then a much more
costly affair than it is to-day, and the reckoning came out well
on the side of slaughter.&nbsp; The worst part of the business,
so far as modern scientific bee-breeders are concerned, is that
the old system of destruction tended to preserve only those
strains of bees who were inveterate swarmers; while the steady,
industrious stay-at-homes, who accumulated the largest stores of
honey, were invariably exterminated.&nbsp; This is a fateful
legacy to have passed on, when we consider that one of <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>the chief
aims of modern bee-science is to abolish swarming
altogether.&nbsp; The swarming habit is one of the greatest
obstacles in the way of a large honey yield, and until a race of
non-swarming bees has been evolved by modern breeders there will
always be this element of uncertainty in the honey harvest.</p>
<p>Latter-day beemen, therefore, join the chorus of disapproval
of this old, senseless custom of bee-burning, rather because it
has given them the task of undoing the work of ages before any
progress is possible, than from the generally accepted
humanitarian reasons.</p>

50</span>CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="GutSmall">AT THE CITY GATES</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a village in Southern Sussex,
close under the green brink of the Downs, there live two
bee-keepers who represent, in their widely divergent methods and
outlook, the extremes of beemanship as still extant in modern
times.</p>
<p>The one dwells in a little ancient thatched cottage, set in
the heart of an old-fashioned English garden, where dome-shaped
hives of straw are dotted about at random amidst a wild growth of
the old-fashioned English flowers.&nbsp; The other has built
himself a trim villa on a hillside, topped with a sheltering
crest of pine-wood; and here he has established a great modern
honey-farm, replete with every device and system of management
known to apiarian scientists throughout the two worlds.</p>

<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>One
might suppose, on leaving the village street on a fine May
morning and coming upon these two settlements in the open country
beyond, that all the romance and old-world flavour of bee-keeping
were inevitably to be found in the ancient bee-garden, where the
droning music of the hives seems to originate in the thicket of
blossoming lilac, and red-may, and veronica, the hives themselves
being the last things one noticed in such a tangle of bright-hued
flowers.&nbsp; To expect sentiment in the other quarter�a
great cindered tract of country, with its long parallel rows of
modern hives, all painted in various colours, its dwelling-house
that might have been transplanted bodily from a well-to-do London
suburb, and its line of outbuildings, with their bustle of
business, and coughing oil-engine, and reverberation of hammer
and saw�was to expect something evidently out-of-date and
impossible.&nbsp; As well look for art in a Ghetto as to seek
reverence for ancient bee-customs in a twentieth-century trading
concern such as this, established to supply the market for honey
just as a Manchester factory turns out calico and corduroy.</p>
<p>Many lovers of country life, peripatetic artists and chance
pedestrians for the most part, came to the village with this
notion firmly impressed upon them, and, visiting the old
bee-garden and finding the old beautiful things there in
abundance, went no farther, and became no wiser.&nbsp; They
wandered round the crooked, red-tiled paths of the garden with
its ancient proprietor; stooped under bowers of living gold and
purple; waded through seas of scarlet poppy and blue
forget-me-not and tawny mignonette; came upon old beehives in all
sorts <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of
shady, unpremeditated corners; and steeped themselves in
medi�valism up to the eyes.&nbsp; The very song of the bees
seemed to belong entirely to past days.&nbsp; None, surely, but a
hopeless Vandal could put a colony of bees in one of the ugly
square hives, and expect them to go honey-seeking in the old
harmonious, happy way, sanctified of the ages.&nbsp; And so they
never ventured up the hill to the great bee-farm, but kept to the
garden below, and listened by the hour together to the quaint
talk of its white-headed, smock-frocked owner, or stood valiantly
at the foot of the ladder when he climbed up to dislodge a swarm
from the moss-grown apple-boughs, or helped him to scour the new
straw skeps with handfuls of mint and lavender, or beat out
weird, unskilful music with the door-key on the old brass-pan
when a swarm was high in the air.</p>
<p>Much could be learnt, it is true, from quiet days spent in the
old bee-garden, especially in May, before the earliest swarms
were ready to forsake the hives.</p>
<p>The first faculty to be acquired was that of wandering among
the bees, or standing between their straw houses, undismayed at
their incessant and often terrifying approaches.&nbsp; Whatever
confidence one may place in bee-keepers� assertions that
their bees never sting, it is a bold man who can preserve entire
equanimity when bees are settling continuously on his hands, his
face, his <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>clothing, and a whole flying squadron of them are
shrilling vindictively about his ears.&nbsp; Nothing will come of
it, he knows, if only he can keep still.&nbsp; But the tendency
to turn and flee, or at least to beat off these minatory atoms
with wildly waving arms, is all but irresistible for the
novice.&nbsp; It is only their way, he is assured, of expressing
or of satisfying their curiosity; and, this being done, they fly
off harmlessly enough to give a good report of him to the ruling
powers within the hive.&nbsp; But he knows that this report is
sometimes anything but good.&nbsp; At least, there are a few
luckless individuals in the world who dare not venture within a
dozen yards of a beehive without being set upon unmercifully, and
chased by an angry squad of these tart virgins for the space of a
quarter-mile.&nbsp; Moreover, in certain states of the
weather�when thunder is about, and the air is tense and
still�bees will often sheath their barbed daggers in any
human skin, even that of their owner, who has gone among them
daily all the season unmolested.&nbsp; There is, therefore, a
fateful element of chance in all near watching of beehives, a
sensation of being under fire�fine discipline enough, but,
for the timorous, hardly to be reckoned among the easy joys of
existence.</p>
<p>These first deterrents, however, being happily overcome, the
watcher is sure to be caught up, sooner or later, in the sheer
fascination of the <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>thing, and to find himself recklessly, almost
breathlessly, looking on at what is nothing else than a great
informing pageant of life.</p>
<p>He stands, as it were, a stranger at the gates of a city,
inhabited by the most interesting, and in some respects the most
advanced, people in the world.&nbsp; Of the inner life of the
city, apart from the deep busy murmur that surges out to him, he
learns nothing, and will learn nothing until he puts sentimental
pride in his pocket, and makes pilgrimage to the great bee-farm
on the hill.&nbsp; But here, in the meanwhile, is food enough to
satisfy the keenest appetite for the marvellous.&nbsp; In and out
through the yawning entrance-gate of the city, under the hot May
sunshine, there are thousands of busy people coming and
going.&nbsp; The broad threshold of the hive is completely hidden
under opposing streams, the one setting out towards the fragrant
fields and hedgerows, the other tumbling and seething in, almost
every bee dragging after her some kind of mysterious
treasure.</p>
<p>The outgoing bees start on their journey in two different
fashions.&nbsp; Some emerge from the hive and rise at once on the
wing, lancing straight off into the sunshine; and these are
foragers, who have already made several journeys afield since the
sun broke, hot and rosy, over the eastward hill.&nbsp; But
others, essaying their first excursion for the day, creep out of
the murmurous darkness <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of the hive, and come with a little
impetuous rush to the edge of the alighting-board.&nbsp; Here
they pause a moment to flutter their wings and rub their great
eyes free of the hive-twilight.&nbsp; And then they lift into the
air, hover an instant with their heads towards their dwelling,
taking careful stock of it, sweep up into the blue, and volley
away with the rest towards the distant hill-side, white with its
bridal wreath of clover-bloom.</p>
<p>The homing bees move much more sedately.&nbsp; They come
sailing in like bronze argosies laden to the water�s
edge.&nbsp; Those bearing full sacs of clover-juice for the
honey-making seldom carry an outside load of pollen as
well.&nbsp; They have all to do in bringing their distended
bodies to a safe anchorage on the entrance-board, and charge
headlong into the hive, possessed of only one idea�to hand
their garnered sweets over to the first house-bee they chance
upon, and then to hurry out in search of another load.&nbsp; The
pollen-bearers are impelled by the same white-hot energy; but
their cargoes are infinitely more cumbersome, and demand a more
leisurely pace.&nbsp; Some with panniers, heaped up with a deep
orange-coloured material, must rest awhile on the threshold
before gathering energy enough to drag their glowing burdens
through the city gate.&nbsp; Others just fail to make the
harbour, and sink down on to the grass below, to wait for the
same <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>freshet of strength that is finally to bring them into
the security of the populous haven.&nbsp; Scores of them do not
try for harbour at first tack, but, coming safely into the calm
waters of the garden, rest awhile on the nearest leaf or blossom,
panting and tremulous, until they are able to wear sail for the
last reach home.</p>
<p>There is infinite diversity in the loads of these
pollen-carrying bees.&nbsp; Hardly a colour, or shade of colour,
in the rainbow fails to pass during every moment across the
thronging way.&nbsp; Every bee carries a half-globe of this
substance, beautifully rounded and shaped, on each of her two
hind-legs.&nbsp; It is possible, by marking the colour of her
burden, to tell with certainty what flower she has been
plundering on each of her trips.&nbsp; This bright orange, which
makes always the largest and heaviest bales in the stream of
merchandise, is from the dandelions.&nbsp; From the gorse-flowers
come loads of deep rich brown almost as weighty.&nbsp; The
charlock, that mingles its useless, wanton beauty with every
farm-crop, yields the bee interminable gold.&nbsp; White clover,
red clover, sainfoin, all load up the little hive coolies with
different shades of russet.&nbsp; From the apple-orchards come
bursting panniers of pale yellow; the blackberry-blossom yields
pollen of a delicate greenish-white.&nbsp; When summer comes, and
the poppies make scarlet undertones amidst the wheat and barley,
these winged merchant-women stream <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>homeward with their pollen-baskets
laden with funereal black.</p>
<p>But, if you watch a hive at work on any bright spring or
summer morning, you will see single bees occasionally pass with
loads whose source has never yet been fathomed.&nbsp; The lean,
glistening, rufous stuff that is continually borne through the
hustling crowd is resin gathered from poplar or pine, and used to
glue the straw hive down to its base-board, or to stop up
draughty crevices and useless corners, or, diluted into varnish,
to paint the honeycombs with an acid-proof, preservative
film.&nbsp; But now and then comes a bee with a load whose colour
shines up like a danger-signal in darkness.&nbsp; Brilliant
scarlet, or soft rose-crimson, or pale lavender, or gleaming
white�who shall say in what far, forgotten nook of the
country-side she has been adventuring, or what rare blossom she
has chanced upon in the wilderness, and, despoiling it of its
maiden treasure greedily, has quickened into duplication the
beauty that was its reason for life?</p>
<p>Yet the greatest wonder about all this pollen-gathering is
that each separate load has been taken entirely from one species
of flower.&nbsp; The little half-spheres are packed into the
pollen-cells indiscriminately, orange on brown, pale yellow
mingled with green, or buff, or grey.&nbsp; But each pair of
panniers, representing a single journey, contains the pollen-dust
of one kind of blossom <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>alone.&nbsp; Going out into an
English lane or meadow to watch the bees at work, the first
conviction borne in upon an observer is that the bees are darting
about from flower to flower without other thought than to load up
from any and every capable blossom that stands in their
way.&nbsp; But closer scrutiny reveals a curious plan and order
in this, as in everything else that the honey-bee
undertakes.&nbsp; Tracing an individual bee in her progress along
the flowery verge of the lane, you will soon see that she visits
only one species of blossom.&nbsp; If she starts on hawthorn, it
will be hawthorn all the way.&nbsp; If her load of
willowherb-nectar or pollen is not yet a full one, she will
overpass a score of tansy-knots or waving jungles of
meadow-sweet, just as inviting and resourceful, apparently, to
reach the one scanty patch of purple at the end of the lane.</p>
<p>Why she should be at such pains to keep the pollen separate as
she gathers it, only to get it inextricably mingled with every
other kind in the storehouse at home, is a problem that none but
a bee can solve.&nbsp; But all the honey-bee�s reasons and
motives in life are made up of a curious blend of cold-drawn
sense and sentiment; and it may be inferred that need and fancy
have an equal influence in guiding her in this, as in everything
else she does, from her cradle-cell to her grave.&nbsp; Not
altogether without seriousness, it may be hazarded that quite as
probable a reason for her way of <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>pollen-gathering is that she deems a
certain shade of colour makes a more becoming flying-robe, as
that she keeps each load of pollen pure, unblended, because of
some imperious, economic need of the hive.&nbsp; The factor of
sex, in all observation of the ways of the honey-bee, is no more
to be considered a negligible one than it is in the critical
contemplation of the human species of hive.</p>
<p>All this incessant coming and going of the busy foragers is
alluring enough to the looker-on, but there is evidence of many
other activities equally interesting.&nbsp; The work of
collecting nectar and pollen is obviously only a part of the
duties of this self-immolated spinster-race.&nbsp; Here and there
in the seething, hurrying crowd there are bees who do not move
with the rest, but, anchored securely in the full force of the
living current, with heads lowered and turned towards the hive,
are engaged in fanning their wings, and this so swiftly that
nothing of the wing but a little grey mist can be seen.&nbsp;
Looking more carefully, you will make out that these bees are
arranged in nearly regular rows, one behind the other, in open
order, so that the conflicting tides of foragers can pass
uninterruptedly between.&nbsp; If the watcher is bold enough to
bring his ear down to the level of the hive, he will make out a
steady hissing noise that rings clear above all the din and
turmoil made by the incessant travellers to and fro.&nbsp; These
rows of fanners are seen to stretch from the hive-door <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>right to the
edge of the footplate, but principally on one side; and still
closer observation will reveal the fact that there is a regular
system of relief among them.&nbsp; Though the general volume of
sound never abates one jot, every few minutes one or another of
these stationary bees moves away, her place being immediately
taken by another, who settles down to the common task in line
with the rest.&nbsp; The reason for all this is plain enough: the
fanners are engaged in ventilating the hive, drawing a current of
vitiated air through the entrance on one side, which flanks, but
does not oppose, a corresponding current of pure air sucked in on
the other.</p>
<p>All through the warm days of spring and summer this fanning
squadron is constantly at work; nor does it cease with the
darkness.&nbsp; Chill nights find the ranks weakened and reduced
to perhaps only a few bees, or even to none at all when a cold
snap of weather intervenes.&nbsp; But in the dog-days, or, as the
ancients used to say, when Sirius, the honey-star, is shining,
the deep sibilant note of these fanners rises, in a populous
apiary, almost to the voice-strength of a gale of wind.&nbsp; To
come out then under the stars of a summer night, and stand
listening in the tense, fragrant darkness to this mighty note, is
to get an impression of bee-life unattainable at any other
season.&nbsp; In the daytime the sound is intermingled,
overwhelmed, by the chorus of the flying bees.&nbsp; But now all
are safely at home.&nbsp; Each hive is packed from floor to roof
with tens of thousands of breathing, heat-producing creatures:
the necessity for ventilation is quadrupled, and, far and wide in
the bee-garden, the fanning armies are setting to their work with
a will.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>The
freshman at this fascinating branch of nature-study, brought out
into the quiet night to hear such gargantuan music, is always
strangely affected by it, some natures incredibly so.&nbsp; In
all the great placid void of darkened hill and dale around him,
in the whole blue arch overhead, alive with the flinching silver
of the stars, there is no sound but a chance trill of a
nightingale, the bark of a shepherd�s dog on the distant
upland, or, now and then, the droning song of a beetle passing
invisibly by.&nbsp; All the world seems at rest, save these
mysterious people in the hives; and with them the sound of labour
is only redoubled.&nbsp; Bending down to the nearest hive in the
darkness, the note comes up to one like the angry roar of the
sea.&nbsp; A light brought cautiously to bear upon it, discloses
the alighting-board covered with rows of bees, working, as it
were, for their lives; while other bees continually wander in and
out of the entrance�the sentries that guard it night and
day, just as soldiers guarded the gates of human cities in olden
times.&nbsp; The novice at bee-craft, even the most staid and
matter-of-fact, is invariably plunged into marvelling silence at
the sight.&nbsp; But <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>if the night be exceptionally hot and
oppressive, and the fanning army unusually large, the bee-master
with an eye for dramatic effect generally finishes the
tiro�s wonderment by showing him an old trick.&nbsp; He
lowers the candle until the flame is just behind the squadron of
ventilating bees, and at once all is darkness: the current of air
drawn out of the hive has proved strong enough to extinguish the
light.</p>
<p>It has been said that there are guard-bees who watch the
hive-door day and night.&nbsp; To the unskilled human eye one bee
looks very like another, and it is difficult to understand how,
in the many thousands that pass, the guards manage to detect an
intruder so unerringly, and to eject her with such unceremonious
promptitude as is always shown.&nbsp; Probably it is not by sight
alone that these occasional interlopers are singled out.&nbsp;
The sense of smell in the honey-bee is extraordinarily acute, and
this, no doubt, assists the guards in their difficult work.&nbsp;
It is well known that a queen-bee must possess a very distinct
odour, as her mere presence abroad, even when shut up in a box,
will attract the drones from all quarters.&nbsp; In all
likelihood the peculiar aroma from each queen-bee impregnates the
whole colony, and thus the guard-bees are able at once to
distinguish their own kin from that of alien stocks.</p>
<p>Still watching the outside life of the hive in the old
bee-garden, many other interesting things <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>come to
light.&nbsp; In such an establishment, even if it be only an
old-fashioned straw skep, perhaps more than twenty thousand
individuals are located; and obviously some regular system of
cleaning and scavenging is indispensable.&nbsp; This work can be
seen now, going on uninterruptedly in the midst of all the other
busy enterprises.&nbsp; Every moment bees come labouring out,
bearing particles of refuse, which they throw over the edge of
the foot-board, and at once shoulder their way back for another
load.&nbsp; Other bees appear, carrying the bodies of comrades
who have died in the hive; and every now and then one comes
struggling through the crowd, bearing high above her a strange
and ghastly thing, perfect replica of herself, but white
throughout, save for its black beady eyes.&nbsp; This is the
unborn bee, dead in its cradle-cell.&nbsp; Infant mortality is an
evil not yet overcome even by the doughty honey-bee, and many are
carried out thus, especially in early spring.&nbsp; Watching
these undertakers of the hive in their gruesome but necessary
work, a singular fact can be noted.&nbsp; While all other debris
is merely cast over the brink of the entrance-board, where it
accumulates day by day on the grass below, these dead larv�
are never disposed of thus.&nbsp; They are carried right away,
their bearers taking wing and flying straight off over the
hedgerow, to drop them at harmless distance from the
neighbourhood of the hive.</p>
<p>There is still another kind of work going briskly <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>forward round
the gates of the bee-city.&nbsp; Certain among these stay-at-home
bees seem to exercise a sort of common overseership.&nbsp; They
help those weighed down with too heavy a cargo to reach the city
gates.&nbsp; If a lump of pollen is dropped in the general
scuffle, these bees seize it and take it into the hive.&nbsp;
Sometimes a bee comes eddying downward, smothered from head to
foot with pollen, like a golden miller, and she is immediately
pounced upon by these superintendents, and combed free of her
incommodious treasure.&nbsp; Others see to the grooming of the
young bees, about to essay their first flight.&nbsp; The
youngster sits up, protruding her tongue to its fullest extent,
while half a dozen bees gather round her, licking and stroking
her on every side.&nbsp; At last her toilette is done, and she is
liberated, when, with a little flutter of her wings, she lifts
high into the blue air and sunshine and makes off with the rest
to the clover-fields, glittering afar off in the joyous midday
light.</p>
<p>For insensibly the hours have worn on�it is
noon�and the tense thronging life, the deep rich
labour-song, of the bee-garden seem to have reached their
height.&nbsp; But suddenly a greater noise than ever arises on
all sides: a steady stream of bees, larger and bulkier than the
rest, is pouring out of every hive.&nbsp; The drones, the lazy
brothers of these laborious vestals, have roused at last from
their sleep, and are coming abroad for their daily flight.&nbsp;
In twos and threes, in whole battalions, they hustle out, <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and begin
their noontide gambols about the hive, filling the air with a
gay, roistering song.&nbsp; In a little while they will be all
gone to their revels, and the bee-garden will seem, by
comparison, strangely quiet.&nbsp; But now the sudden accession
of energy is unmistakable.&nbsp; With the awakening of the drones
there seems to be a new spirit abroad.&nbsp; The air is no longer
filled to overflowing with busy foragers.&nbsp; Many of these
have joined the dance round the hives, so that each bee-dwelling
is the centre of a singing, gambolling crowd, moved rather by a
spirit of play, almost of idleness.&nbsp; But this brief moment
of relaxation soon passes.&nbsp; The drones betake themselves to
their marital pleasuring in the fields.&nbsp; The noisy midday
symphony dies down to the old steady monotone of work.&nbsp; And
the watcher at the gates of the bee-city turns to retrace his
steps down the flower-garlanded way of the old pleasance,
satiated with wonders, yet not satisfied, his curiosity only
quickened a thousandfold for that which has been inexorably held
from him, a glimpse of what is happening behind those baffling
walls of straw.</p>
<p>Wending slowly homeward, and pondering, he asks himself many
questions.&nbsp; What is the reason, the final outcome, of all
this earnest, well-directed labour?&nbsp; What is done with the
pollen that has been carried in all the morning long?&nbsp; Where
there is obviously so much system, and unanimity, <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>and ingenious
division of endeavour, there cannot fail to be a supreme and
governing intelligence to allot the part that each must
play.&nbsp; This story of a queen�of a single bee, larger
than all the rest, to whom all pay allegiance, and who spends her
whole life in the dim labyrinth of the hive, like the Pope in the
Vatican�is it a truth, or only a figment of the ignorant,
bucolic brain?&nbsp; If this queen exist, if every hive have
indeed its absolute monarch, who directs the whole complex life
and policy of the bee-city, where in the scale of reasoning
creatures must she be placed?</p>
<p>And then, if he be wise, the student will learn at last to
give the picturesque old bee-garden its true appraisement.&nbsp;
Ancient things conserve their beauty, and win the love of the
right kind of lovers, more and more with every century that
glides by.&nbsp; Only their usefulness, their import in the tide
of human knowledge and progress, has gone with the years.&nbsp;
It is so with the bee-garden under its Maytide robe of green
leaves and rainbow blossoms.&nbsp; It is beautiful in its glad
appearances, its echo of old voices, its odour of the sanctity in
ancient ways and days.&nbsp; But it can tell us nothing of all we
want to know.&nbsp; It can only ask us riddles to which we have
no answers.&nbsp; For these we must set aside old fanciful
scruples; turn our backs, once for all, on its enchantment and
its sweetness; bend our steps unswervingly towards the great
modern bee-farm on the hill.</p>
<h2><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="GutSmall">THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE HIVE</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Doctor Dryasdust</span> will manage to
impart to the truths he meddles with a disastrous air of dulness
and stagnation; but to walk in a fools� paradise of
beautiful, artistic error is to lay oneself open to an infinitely
worse fate.&nbsp; There never was a truth in Nature that was dull
or uninteresting, except in its human presentment.&nbsp; There
never was a pretty worthless fiction that did not show its dross
and tinsel when brought out into the searching light of
day.&nbsp; Romance, the spirit of poetry, have largely changed
their venue of recent years.&nbsp; The unconscionable delver
among old things, old thoughts, old conventions, on the strand of
Time, has tarried so long in his one little florid corner that he
is in some danger of being caught by the tide.&nbsp; He must soon
either mend his pace or swim for it.&nbsp; Human regard is
turning more and more towards those who deal in living
verities�the men who search the stars, who win new powers
out of the common air, who find at last the authentic teachings
in the old worn <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>texts of the stones and brooks.&nbsp; These are the true
poets, romancists, tellers of wondrous tales; and these will hold
the crowd�which is never far astray in its
intuitions�when all the singers of sick fancies and the
harpers on frayed golden strings have gone off in melancholy
dudgeon to their own place.</p>
<p>The old story�which has held such a long and honoured
position in school text-books, and in the writings of those who
tell of Nature�s wonders from the commanding watch-tower of
the study fire�the old story of the queen-bee ruling her
thirty or forty thousand dutiful subjects, and guiding them
unerringly in all their marvellous exploits and enterprises, must
go now with the rest.&nbsp; For the truth, as modern observers
have unquestionably established it, is that the queen-bee is no
ruler in the hive, but even a more obedient subject than
any.&nbsp; The real instigators and contrivers of everything that
takes place within the hive are the worker-bees themselves.&nbsp;
The queen has neither part nor lot in the direction of the common
polity; nor has she any power, mental or physical, to help in the
carrying out of public works.&nbsp; Her sole duty is that of
motherhood, and even in this she derives all initiative from the
sovereign worker-bees.&nbsp; She is little more than an ingenious
piece of mechanism, and carefully guarded and cherished
accordingly.&nbsp; She has certain propensities, and certain
elemental passions, which she can always <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>be counted on
to exercise in certain well-defined and limited ways.&nbsp; But
as an intelligent, originating force she counts for
nothing.&nbsp; The mind in the hive is the collective mind of the
whole colony, apart from the queen and drones�an
hereditary, communal intellect evolved through the ages, the sum
and total of all bee experience since the world of bees
began.</p>
<p>If, however, modern science compels us to divest the
mother-bee of all her regal state and quality, and thus destroy
one of the prettiest delusions of ancient times, it is only to
take up a story of real life more alluring and romantic
still.&nbsp; In the light of new understanding the old facts take
on a mystery and excite a wonderment greater than ever
before.&nbsp; If we found the life of the hive an enthralling
study when we supposed it to originate from one winged atom
endowed with acute and commanding abilities, how much more
fascinating must it prove when we come to see that all this
complex system of government is instituted and kept together by
the harmonious working of tens of thousands of reasoning
beings?</p>
<p>Reasoning�it is a big word, a double-edged thing that
requires careful handling.&nbsp; We have been so long accustomed
to use it only in regard to our own magnificent mental processes
that it savours almost of the ridiculous to bring it to bear upon
such a tiny et-cetera in the brute creation as the
honey-bee.&nbsp; And yet, the deeper we go in the <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>study of the
bee and all her works, the more difficult it becomes to find a
word that shall more fittingly meet the case.&nbsp; Instinct will
not do.&nbsp; Instinct implies a dead perfection of motive, born
of omniscience, working through unthinking, unvarying organisms
to an equally perfect end.&nbsp; But in neither project nor
performance can the honey-bee be said invariably to achieve, or
even to aim at, perfection.&nbsp; It will be seen hereafter that
her motives, her methods, the results she brings about, all show
frequent, undeniable error or deviation.&nbsp; She attempts to
carry through a sound enterprise, but abandons it on finding
unforeseen difficulties in the way.&nbsp; She will persevere
blindly in an obviously foolish piece of business, and fail to
see her mistake until both energy and resources are at an
end.&nbsp; Sudden emergencies may find her ready with the saving
stroke of last ingenuity, or merely plunge her into listless
despair.&nbsp; Courage, industry, economy, wise forethought, or
still wiser afterthought, are all common traits in her
nature.&nbsp; But she may develop idleness, unthrift,
slovenliness, or even downright dishonesty, if chance or
circumstance indicate the way.</p>
<p>And what are all these but the defects or attributes of
reason?&nbsp; If bees and men, each admittedly rooted in
divinity, be prone to the like failings and inconsequences, who
shall discriminate between them, dividing arbitrarily natural
cause and effect?</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>Watching bees at work for the first time through the
glass panels of an observation hive, or in the almost equally
informing modern hive with movable combs, this question
continually arises, and there seems only one answer for it.&nbsp;
There is something curiously human-like in their movements over
the crowded combs, and the old comparison of a beehive to a city
of men is never out of mind.&nbsp; There are the incessant
hurryings to and fro; chance meetings of friends at odd
street-corners; altercations where we can almost hear the surly
complaint and tart reply; busy masons and tilers and
warehouse-hands at work everywhere: a hundred different
enterprises going forward in every thronging thoroughfare or
narrow side-lane, from the great main entrance to the remotest
drone-haunted corner of the hive.</p>
<p>You will see the huge, full-bodied queen labouring over the
combs from cell to cell, with a circle of attendants ever about
her.&nbsp; In the highest stories of the hive the honey-makers
are at work, pouring the new-garnered sweets into the vats, or
sealing over with impervious wax the mature honey.&nbsp; Where
the nurseries are established, in the central and warmest region
of the hive, the nurse-bees are hurrying incessantly over the
combs, looking into each cell to mark the progress of the
larv�; giving each its due ration of bee-milk; or, when the
time arrives, walling up the cell with a covering that shall
insure its privacy, <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>but freely admit the air.&nbsp; Here and there the young
bees have awakened from their transforming slumber, and are
clamouring at the stoppings of their prenatal tombs, gnawing
their way out vigorously, or thrusting forth red, glistening,
ravenous tongues, eager to end their long fast.&nbsp; Where these
raw youngsters have at last won their way into existence, they
can be seen assiduously grooming themselves, or searching the
neighbouring comb for honey, while the nurse-bees are busy
cleaning out the cells, just vacated, to make them ready for the
queen when she comes by on her next egg laying round.</p>
<p>And all these operations are going forward simultaneously on
an incredibly large scale.&nbsp; Certain amazing scraps of
information are given to the wondering on-looker, which he hears,
but can, at this stage in his progress, seldom rightly
estimate.&nbsp; He is told that the queen is the only mother-bee
in the colony, large as it is; that, in the prime of her
maternity, she will lay as many as 3,000 eggs a day; and that she
has the power to produce either male or female eggs, or none at
all, at will.&nbsp; He is told that, except when she leads forth
the swarm, she goes out of the hive only once in her life, and
this is her wedding-trip.&nbsp; On this one occasion she has
traffic with the drone somewhere incredibly high up in the blue
air and sunshine of the summer�s day; and that immediate
death is her suitor�s invariable portion; that she returns
at once to the hive, and thereafter for the rest of her life,
which may endure for years, she passes her time in immaculate
widowhood, yet retaining her fertility to the end.</p>

<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>She is
pointed out to the gaping novice as she travels her unceasing
round of the brood-combs, and her various attributes are
explained to him.&nbsp; He is shown how much larger she is than
the worker-bee; how her bodily structure differs in a dozen
important ways; how her instincts and habits resemble those of
the common worker hardly in a single particular.&nbsp; Finally he
is told something at which the most polite credulity may well
demur.&nbsp; Although the mother-bee is to all appearances of a
totally different race, the egg from which she was raised was
identical with that which produces the little worker.&nbsp; Her
bodily size, the change in the number and shape of her organs,
her mental differences, are all due to treatment and diet
alone.&nbsp; There is no reason why she should not have been an
ordinary neuter working-bee, nor why any one of the thirty or
forty thousand little workers in a hive should not have become a
great queen-bee, the sole mother of an entire colony, save for
the edict of the communal mind.&nbsp; More wonderful still, the
drones, the male bees�the brothers, never the fathers, of
their own hive, as has been so often stated�owe the fact of
their sex entirely to the will or whim of the hive authorities,
working through the docile agency of the queen.&nbsp; Until the
moment before the egg is laid, the question of the sex of the
resulting bee <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>is held in abeyance.&nbsp; This big lusty drone, with
exuberant masculinity obvious in every posture and act; his
totally different organism; his incapacity for anything else than
the fulfilment of the one office required of him, for he cannot
even entirely feed himself; his habit of spending his life either
in a comfortable lethargy of repletion at home, or in amorous
knight-errantry abroad�this drone might have been a little
plodding worker-bee, with shrunken yet elaborated body and
curiously developed brain, whose one idea in life is to get
through the largest amount of work before death claims her, and
who is armed with a formidable poisoned sting, while the drone
has none.</p>
<p>It is useless at this stage to tell the learner that all these
vital differences�miracles, indeed, in the ordinary meaning
of the word�are brought about by the leading powers of the
hive in certain simple, easily explainable ways.&nbsp; He has
lost, for the moment, all sight of and interest in the details,
however extraordinary, in the perception that has dawned on him
of the vastness of the entire plan.&nbsp; Here is a community
that, to all appearances, has solved every problem relating to
the well-being and progress of a crowded, highly organised
society.&nbsp; Questions that are now vexing socialistic
philosophers in the human world, or are looming dark in the
immediate future�problems of numerical increase in relation
to food-supply, the balance of <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the sexes, communal or individual
ownership in property, due qualification for parenthood, the
hegemony of might or right�all seem to have been happily
settled long ago in this remarkable bee-commonwealth.&nbsp; In
itself a prosperous, well-conducted hive appears to offer a
living example, a perfect object-lesson of what Socialism,
carried out to its last and sternest conclusions, must mean to
human and apiarian communities alike.&nbsp; Here is a number of
individuals�counting anything from ten thousand to fifty or
sixty thousand, according to their condition and the time of
year�living heathily and comfortably in the space of a few
cubic feet.&nbsp; The principle, all for the greatest good of the
greatest number, is elevated into a prime maxim, to which every
one must bow.&nbsp; The fiction of royalty is maintained in
harmony with the perfect republican spirit.&nbsp; The females are
supreme in everything, the males in nothing.&nbsp; Growth of
population is accelerated or retarded, according to estimations
of the immediate or future supply of food.&nbsp; The proportion
of the sexes is varied at will.&nbsp; The rule, that those who
cannot work must not live, is applied with relentless
consistency.&nbsp; All the garnered wealth of the State is held
in common for the common good.&nbsp; When the settlement becomes
too populous, and the boundaries cannot be extended, a large part
of its inhabitants are forced to emigrate, taking with them only
so much of the state property as <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>they can carry in their haversacks,
and relinquishing all claim to the rest.&nbsp; The governing
females have apparently agreed among themselves that only one of
their number shall exercise the privilege of motherhood; and when
her fertility declines, she is deposed, and a new mother-bee,
specially raised for the purpose, installed in her place.</p>
<p>All these, and a host of other facts as to bee-life, are
crowded into the bewildered brain of the tiro until its capacity
is exhausted, and he can take no more.&nbsp; He begins to see, at
length, that he is approaching a great matter too fast, and from
the wrong direction.&nbsp; Like a scholar who, resolving on a new
and difficult branch of study, commences at the end of his
treatise instead of at the beginning, he finds himself in the
midst of terms and equations of which he knows nothing.&nbsp; All
this desultory peering into hive-windows, and listening to scraps
of astounding information, is nothing but opening the book of
bee-life here and there at odd disjointed pages, getting a swift
impression of certain lurid, kaleidoscopic details, but no
grounding in the consecutive science of the facts.&nbsp; There is
nothing for it�if he be resolved to know the life of the
honey-bee truly�but to turn back to the first page of the
volume, and steadily work his way through to the end�if end
there be.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>All know the English honey-bee�the Black Bee, as she is
called, partly to distinguish her from her <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>foreign
rivals, and partly, it would seem, because she is not black at
all, but a rich brown�but all do not know her origin.&nbsp;
Probably she came to us from the tropics by easy stages, swarm
out-flying swarm, until the most adventurous crossed the English
Channel in remote ages, when it was only a narrow race of water,
or even before Great Britain was detached from the mainland.</p>
<p>It was the black bee, and not the motley-coloured Italian or
other varieties, who came to us thus, for the same reason,
probably, that the Celts came�because they were a hardy
race, loving, and being more fitted for the bracing northern
atmosphere than the heat and languor of the south.&nbsp; Modern
bee-breeders who are trying so hard to acclimatise in Britain the
golden-girdled or silver-fringed bee-races of other lands, might
well ponder this fact.&nbsp; No keener controversy rages to-day
among English bee-masters than this one of the relative merits of
native and foreign stocks.&nbsp; But assuredly Nature has not
erred in this respect.&nbsp; South Down sheep can be reared in
any county, but nowhere so fine as on the Sussex Downs.&nbsp; The
like principle holds good with the English bee.&nbsp; The ages
have evolved her from her tropic beginnings to make her what she
is�a doughty, essentially British creature, thriving
against all odds of fickle climate, when her more tender sisters
from the south are hard put to it for a living.&nbsp; She has
held her own against them, <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>and more than her own.&nbsp; In
bumper seasons, such as we get all too rarely, when, in sober
truth, the land is flowing with honey, there is little to choose
between the rival honey-makers.&nbsp; But through good and bad,
early and late, for steady, dogged industry, invincible
hardihood, tangible results, the English black bee has
out-distanced all competitors.&nbsp; Thousands of years have gone
to her making, and thousands more may conceivably fit the
yellow-skirted Ligurian for British work.&nbsp; But labour for so
remote a posterity were altruism meeter for angels than for
men.</p>
<p>In her old prim�val fastnesses the honey-bee is little
likely to have troubled herself with hive-making, but to have
hung her combs to some convenient branch in the forest, much as
the bees in India do to-day.&nbsp; The habit of seeking some
hollow tree or cleft in the rock grew upon her probably as she
advanced northward, and some nightly or seasonal shelter became
more and more an imperious need.&nbsp; The present-day customs of
wild creatures give some inkling of their ancestral ways, but it
is in their occasional aberrations from these customs that we get
the truest indications of what their original state must have
been.&nbsp; Lost swarms of bees, if they fail to pitch upon some
better site, will often build in the open, either suspending
their waxen houses from some horizontal branch, or making them in
the heart of a thick bush.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>The
ways of the honey-bee are full of such deviations, due, perhaps,
to the working of old ancestral memory rousing dimly in the midst
of modern needs.&nbsp; The issue of a swarm may be nothing else
than the survival of an old process, vital enough in its day,
but, under the present civilised conditions of bee-life, lacking
the whet of entire necessity.&nbsp; For, in all respects, the
life of the bee, ancient as it is, is an evolved civilisation,
and not a surviving, aboriginal state.&nbsp; It is conceivable
that the foxes have their holes, and the birds their nests, much
after the same fashion as in the days when Adam invented
love-making.&nbsp; But the twentieth-century honey-bee is not of
this kind.&nbsp; The communal habit itself may even have been a
comparatively late introduction in her progress.&nbsp; It is
possible to get some idea of the path she won for herself through
the ages by studying the ways of creatures now living, but
immeasurably less advanced than the bee.&nbsp; There are distant
connections of hers�lonely little wood-wasps and
others�which never associate with their kind, but get
through the short summer hours in solitude, and die with the
waning season, leaving the perpetuation of their species to the
children they never see.&nbsp; The common wasp is nearer the
honey-bee in development, but still infinitely far behind.&nbsp;
The fecundated queen-wasp comes out of her winter hiding-place,
fashions a cell or two in some hole in the ground, and <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>deposits her
first eggs, thus laying the foundation of a colony which,
populous enough in the season, must nevertheless perish with the
next winter chills.</p>
<p>In the prim�val tropics the honey-bees may have lived in
separate families, each with its teeming mother, its indolent,
lie-abed father�the Turveydrop of creation�and its
bevy of youngsters, every one going out, when grown, to establish
a home for itself.&nbsp; The modern bee-city, with its
complicated systems and laws, and its innumerable multitudes, may
have originated only when change of habitat and climate brought
about the necessity for a new order of things.&nbsp; Living in
perpetual warmth, in a land where blossom followed blossom in
unending succession, there would be no need for such
co-operation.&nbsp; The one little family, snugging close in its
moss-roofed corner, could sustain its own temperature; and where
there was unceasing array of nectar-producing flowers, foresight
would have been folly: the winter larder would have been left to
take care of itself.</p>
<p>But as the young bees, leaving their homes, and flying ever
northward, came first into temperate zones, and then into the
fringe of Arctic influences, the conditions gradually
changed.&nbsp; The perpetual sipping-garden was left behind; and
a season came in each year�short at first, but inevitably
lengthening�when there were no flowers.&nbsp; Hard
necessity must have taught the bee, then, first to gather <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>together with
her kind for warmth during the cold season; and then, as this got
longer and longer, to make some food-provision for winter days
that would eke out endurance until the spring sun again wooed the
earth into flower-giving.&nbsp; Thus the first communal bee-nests
must have been evolved from the universal need of the race: the
first common storehouses instituted: a host of unforeseen
difficulties and side-issues encountered, and means for dealing
with them contrived.&nbsp; The spirit of invention must have been
busy then with the race, and taxed to the limit, of her
resources.&nbsp; For never did Pandora open celestial casket upon
earth with more redoubtable consequences, than when the Great
Artificer set up the honey-bee as an examplar of city-building to
the nomadic world of men.</p>
<p>From the crowding together of the separate bee-families for
mutual protection against the elements, to a complete and
permanent fusion of life and interests, must have been only a
step, as Nature works.&nbsp; But then there must have been
stirring times�social upheavals, educative disasters, a
cataclysmic war of sex.&nbsp; Bee-life must have been shaken to
its very foundations.&nbsp; When and how the woman-bee first got
the upper hand in the direction of affairs, it is unimportant to
determine.&nbsp; But it is certain that she got it, and has kept
it ever since.&nbsp; The population problem must have been the
great, overwhelming one.&nbsp; <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>With hundreds of prolific mothers in
the hive, each having enough to do at home in rearing her own
children, and a crowd of lazy, irresponsible drones who could do
nothing but dance in the sunshine or go a-wooing, how were the
daily needs of the hive to be satisfied, leaving out of account
the provision that must be made for coming winter days?&nbsp; It
was clearly a case of reform or annihilation; and it may be
conceived that the woman-bees, in default of masculine
initiative, took the reins into their own hands.</p>
<p>It is a prophetic story.&nbsp; First they discovered their
latent powers.&nbsp; The harmless ovipositor revealed itself as a
prime weapon of offence.&nbsp; Thus the army was with the
revolutionaries, and the rest was easy.&nbsp; A great,
far-reaching scheme was set afoot.&nbsp; Motherhood was to be a
privilege of the few and the fittest; work the compulsory lot of
the mass.&nbsp; Hard times had already bred a lean, unfertile
gang among them, and it was discovered that famine rations in the
nursery meant a wholesale increase in these natural spinsters of
the race.&nbsp; Henceforth the little sex-atrophied worker-bee
was multiplied in the hive, while the fully nurtured mothers were
gradually reduced to a few�at last to one alone.&nbsp; It
was a triumph of collective self-sacrifice for the well-being and
high persistence of the race.</p>
<p>All this may be imagined as having taken place in infinitely
remote times, long before man <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>succeeded in distinguishing himself
from the apes.&nbsp; In the honey-bee of to-day, and her life in
the modern hive, we get a sort of quintessence of the ages; a
creature developed in mind and body by her unique conditions,
these conditions again imposing upon her unique systems of
life.&nbsp; Like Ruskin�s Venetian, she must live nobly or
perish.&nbsp; Much more is required of her than the role of
domestic and political economist.&nbsp; To make the modern
beehive a possibility there must be architects, mathematicians,
and chemists within its walls.&nbsp; Sanitary science must have
its skilled exponents, or the hive would change into a death-trap
within a few hours.&nbsp; There must be land-surveyors ready to
explore the country, just before the issue of the swarms, to
determine for them their new location.&nbsp; There must be
overseers, gang-forewomen, everywhere to superintend every work
in progress throughout the hive.&nbsp; Above all, there must be a
supreme central power, a farseeing intelligence, to divine the
imminent common need, and to set the forces of the State to work,
in right time and order, to provide for it.&nbsp; If all these
cannot be proved to exist in a hive of bees to-day, at least the
necessity for them is undeniable; and as undeniable, the achieved
results.</p>

84</span>CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="GutSmall">EARLY WORK IN THE BEE-CITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> �turn of the days,�
when the winter sun has passed its nadir of feebleness and just
made its earliest wan recovery in the skies, marks the true
beginning of the honey-bee�s year.&nbsp; Then the first few
eggs are laid in the heart of the brood-nest; the drowsy cluster
begins to show an interest in life; the water-carriers bestir
themselves, watching for a bright warm morning that they may
sally forth to ply their trade.</p>
<p>Dangerous work it is at this season, yet most necessary.&nbsp;
Without water the rearing of the young bees is impossible on any
but the smallest scale.&nbsp; Water is needed at every stage of
their development, and, lacking it, the progress of the colony
must be fatally checked.&nbsp; Even the mature bees will starve
and die in the midst of plenty, if their honey-stores are
candied, and no water is available to dissolve the inassimilable
sweets.&nbsp; The hive that shows honey crystals thrown down on
the floor, and littering the entrance, is sure to <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>be in
desperate case.&nbsp; The bees are tearing open every store-cell,
casting away the solidified honey as refuse, to get at the
moister portion below.&nbsp; If the cold spell does not break, or
the bee-master is unready with his artificial supplies, the
colony must perish.&nbsp; So the water-bearers watch for the
sunshine, and its first warm glance brings them out to rifle the
nearest dewdrops, or track down by its bubbling music the hidden
woodland stream.&nbsp; Many die at this work in the early months
of the year, chilled by their load on the homeward journey, or
snapped up by hungry birds.&nbsp; But at every cost the future
life of the colony must be assured, though, of all the
hive-people, none but the queen-mother will be alive to see it in
its summer fulness.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to think of a hive of bees as a permanent
institution, Death playing his old, unceasing, busy part, but
young Life more than outplaying him, just as the way is in a
city-hive of men.&nbsp; The analogy holds good, but in bee-life
the changes are infinitely more rapid.&nbsp; The life of the
worker-bee extends, at most, to six months or so; and in the busy
season she may die, worn out by labour, in as many weeks.&nbsp;
The reapers of last year�s honey-harvest were dead by the
autumn.&nbsp; The late-born bees, that went into winter quarters
with polished thorax and ragged wings, survived only long enough
to nurture their immediate successors; and these, again, will
live <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>but
to bring to maturity the young spring-broods.&nbsp; Not a bee
among them will ever again go honey-gathering.&nbsp; Except for
the long-lived queen-mother, and the old hive and its furniture,
each colony with every year becomes a totally new thing.</p>
<p>Hibernation, in the true sense of the word, has no part in
bee-life.&nbsp; The queen-wasp and countless other creatures
hibernate, passing the cold months in a torpor of sleep until the
enduring warmth of another year lures them back to active
existence.&nbsp; But the honey-bees have a better way: they
gather together in a dense, all but motionless cluster in the
heart of the hive, with their precious queen in their midst and
their food-stores above them.&nbsp; At this time honey is their
only necessary food, and very little of this suffices to keep up
the needful temperature of the colony.&nbsp; When they are out
and about at their work, or busy within the hive, the nitrogenous
pollen must be added to their daily ration of nectar to build up
wasted tissues; but now honey, the nectar concentrated, the
heat-producer, is all they want.&nbsp; The bees of the cluster
nearest to the combs broach the full cells beneath them, and the
honey is passed through the crowd, each bee getting its scanty
dole.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Economy
is now reduced to a fine art.&nbsp; None knows when a fresh
supply may be available, although no chance will be lost to
replenish the larder at the first sign of returning warmth.&nbsp;
But now the barest minimum of food is taken, and as the nearest
cells become emptied of their contents, the cluster moves a step
upward.&nbsp; Thus there is a system of slow browsing over the
combs, until the dense flock of bees has reached the highest
limit of the hive, when new grazing-ground must be taken.&nbsp;
But the movement of the cluster is exceedingly slow, perhaps the
slowest thing in the animate world.&nbsp; All recognise that
existence depends on the stores being eked out to their
uttermost.&nbsp; It is a scientific damping-down of the fires of
life�a carefully thought-out and perfected plan for
preserving the greatest possible number of worker-bees alive on
the smallest practicable amount of food, so that the largest
possible army of nurse-bees and foragers may be at hand in the
springtime to raise the young bees that are to represent the
future colony.</p>
<p>But there is no hibernation.&nbsp; It is doubtful even if bees
ever sleep, either in their season of greatest activity or in the
coldest depths of winter.&nbsp; At all times a slight rap on the
hive will awaken an immediate timorous outcry within.&nbsp;
Sturdy knocking will soon bring the guard-bees to the entrance to
find out the cause of the disturbance, and many bees lose their
lives from this vigilant habit alone.&nbsp; On frosty days the
tits may often be seen perched on the entrance-board of a hive,
beating out a noisy tattoo, and snapping up every <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>bee that
emerges; and many other small birds have discovered the same
never-failing source of a meal.</p>
<p>The fact that, with a healthy stock of bees, the interior of a
hive always preserves its clean condition, is usually a great
puzzle to the novice.&nbsp; In the summer, when the bees are
passing continually in and out, this is not so vast a matter for
wonder.&nbsp; But in winter-time, when the colony is confined to
the hive often for weeks together, it is remarkable that neither
the combs nor floor of the hive are ever soiled by excreta.&nbsp;
This is a difficulty that the sanitary department in the hive has
successfully coped with long ago.&nbsp; It must have been one of
the earliest problems that presented itself when the honey-bee
first evolved the communal habit.&nbsp; The Ancients believed
that all the excreta of the hive were deposited by the bees in
certain privy-cells, and thence removed at intervals by the
scavenging authorities.&nbsp; There is nothing in this notion,
absurd as it is, outside the scope of bee-ingenuity; on the
contrary, such a crude device would be little likely to commend
itself to the hive-people, as it would be ridiculously inadequate
to the case.&nbsp; How great must be the problem of the
preservation of cleanliness in a hive, can only be understood
when the whole conditions are considered together, and that from
a human standpoint.&nbsp; Putting the figures unwarrantably low,
what measure of success could the greatest genius <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>that ever
lived among sanitary scientists ever hope to achieve, if he were
given the task of keeping in cleanly condition, perfect
ventilation, and even temperature, a building where 10,000
individuals were crowded together storey above storey�a
building hermetically sealed throughout except for one small
opening at the lowest level, which must serve for all purposes of
entrance and exit to its denizens, as well as sole conduit for
the removal of the foul air and introduction of the pure?&nbsp;
The task would be gigantic enough in the summer-time, when a
large proportion of the inhabitants were away at work during a
greater part of the day; but in winter, when all were
continuously at home for weeks together, what conceivable device,
or combination of devices, could prevent the building soon
developing into first a quagmire and then a charnel-house, to
which the Black Hole of Calcutta would be a model sanitary
retreat?</p>
<p>Yet the difference between such a building and a beehive is
only one of degree.&nbsp; The same conditions are involved, and
the same evils must be combated.&nbsp; Relatively, the problem is
the same in each.&nbsp; In the case of the beehive, the necessity
for this close system of life has been very gradually imposed on
its inhabitants; and age-long custom, working on the individual,
has at length produced a race marvellously adapted to its special
needs.&nbsp; Probably the habit of retention of f�ces while
in <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>the
hive was at first a voluntary one.&nbsp; This, carried on from
generation to generation, would react on the physical organism
until use became second nature, and finally the present condition
was reached.&nbsp; It is a fact that the bee is now incapable of
voiding its excreta within the hive, or when at rest.&nbsp; The
muscles involved can come into action only during, or immediately
after, vigorous flight.&nbsp; In the winter, when long spells of
cold occur, not a bee leaves the hive perhaps for weeks together;
but an hour�s warm sunshine will infallibly bring the whole
company out in a little eddying crowd about the hive, and then
the necessary action of nature can readily be seen.&nbsp; These
cleansing flights occur on all practicable occasions, and fulfil
a double purpose; for when the cluster forms again, it will be
between combs where the stores are unexploited, and the old,
steady, upward feeding-march begins again in a new place.&nbsp;
In extraordinary seasons, when the cold weather is much
prolonged, the population of a hive may die of starvation within
reach of plenty, no opportunity for these flights having
presented itself, and the cluster therefore not having left its
original station.&nbsp; And here the bee is plainly the victim of
her own advanced acumen.&nbsp; Instinct would never have led her
into such a foolish plight; but reason, being liable to err, errs
here egregiously.</p>
<p>The comparison of a modern beehive with a <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>building
similar in construction, and as densely crowded with human
beings, brings the whole problem to a sharp definition.&nbsp; In
such a building, unless a through-current of air could be
established, the preservation of life must soon become
impossible.&nbsp; Yet the bees have triumphantly overcome all
difficulties.&nbsp; Whether in winter or summer, the air within
the hive is almost as pure as that in the open, while the
temperature can be regulated at will.&nbsp; For the ordinary
purposes of the hive�honey-brewing, and the hatching of the
young brood�it is kept uniformly at 80� to
85�.&nbsp; When the wax-makers are at work, it rises suddenly
to 95� or so, while at the time of the swarming-fever it is
often allowed to go even higher.&nbsp; In the hottest days of
summer, however, unless the emigration-furore possesses the
colony, the interior of a well-made hive seldom shows a
temperature of more than 80�.&nbsp; And all this is brought
about in a very simple fashion.</p>
<p>The sanitary expert, of merely human stock, could attack the
problem in only one way.&nbsp; He must have a through-current of
air, impelled either mechanically or automatically; and he must
have heating-apparatus acting within the building itself, or
warming the incoming draught of air.&nbsp; But the bees work on
totally different principles.&nbsp; They will have nothing to do
with the through-current system of ventilation.&nbsp; If the
ingenious bee-master pierce air-holes in the walls of a hive, the
bees <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>will
spend the night in carefully stopping them up again.&nbsp; In the
old bee-garden we saw the fanning-army drawing out the impure
air.&nbsp; These bees had their heads pointing towards the
entrance; but, inside the hive, there was another army of
fanners, facing the opposite way, and thus helping to drive the
same sidelong current.&nbsp; Throughout nearly the whole interior
of the hive on hot days fanning-bees can be seen, all helping to
keep up this movement.&nbsp; The result is that the pure air,
being sucked in at one side of the entrance, flows round the hive
and travels out at the other side, much as a rope goes over a
pulley-block.&nbsp; The swiftest current of air keeps to the
walls and roof of the hive, the air in the centre being changed
more slowly.&nbsp; Thus the honeycombs, which are always in the
upper stories, lie in the full stream, and the moisture, which
the maturing honey is continually giving off, is carried rapidly
away; while the brood-combs, lying in the lower, central part,
are ventilated more slowly, the air being thoroughly warmed
before it reaches them.&nbsp; The larger the fanning-army is, the
more swiftly flows the air, and the faster the heat of the hive
is carried off.&nbsp; In this way the bees can regulate the
hive-temperature to the requirements of the moment, putting more
numerous gangs to work in the hottest season, or stopping the
fanners altogether in mid-winter, when the natural, buoyant
heat-exhalation from the cluster is sufficient to <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>keep up the
gentle circulation which then is alone needed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the colony is unusually large, the
fanning-party will be divided into two detachments, one at each
side of the entrance, leaving the centre for the inflow of
air.&nbsp; In this case a double-loop system of ventilation
appears to be formed.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE GENESIS OF THE QUEEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been said that the ways of
the honey-bee are nearly all subject to variation�that in
bee-life there are few hard-and-fast, undeviating laws.&nbsp; The
rule, of one queen-mother only to each hive, appears to be more
absolute than any other, yet it is not without its
exceptions.&nbsp; Well authenticated instances are on record
where two queens have existed amicably in the same hive, each
laying her daily quota of eggs unmolested by the other, and,
apparently, with the full approval of the hive-authorities.</p>
<p>It is now also certain that a skilful bee-master can accustom
his bees to the presence of more than one queen.&nbsp; Recent
experiments in America on this head, although convincing enough
as far as they go, need the test of time before their practical
value to apiculture can be rightly estimated.&nbsp; To multiply
its domestic deities may prove anything but a blessing to the
harmony and welfare of a hive.&nbsp; But the fact has been well
established that the old rule, of one queen at a time, may be
upset�whether permanently, and for the ultimate advantage
of honey-making, time alone can tell.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>A
single queen, when young and vigorous and of good blood, is able
to keep an entire hive filled with brood throughout the short
honey-gathering season.&nbsp; The brood-nest of a modern
frame-bar hive has a comb-surface of over 2,000 square inches,
giving about 50,000 cells available for the breeding of young
worker-bees.&nbsp; This represents, at times of greatest
prosperity, an enormous floating population; but if several
queens can be permanently established in one hive, and the hives
enlarged to permit each her fullest scope, the figures will soon
begin to stretch out into infinity.&nbsp; Two facts are well
known to experienced bee-keepers�that a large stock gathers
more honey than two small stocks containing between them the same
number of individuals; and that, when the honey-crop is in full
yield, there are seldom enough bees to harvest it.&nbsp; The
whole art of latter-day bee-keeping consists in bringing up the
numerical strength of each colony to its fullest in time for the
great main nectar-flow.&nbsp; Yet, in a good district and in a
good season, when huge areas of clover or sainfoin come into full
blossom at the same time, and the nectar must be gathered or lost
within the space of a fortnight or so, the most populous apiary
is seldom equal to the task.&nbsp; Probably, in exceptional
seasons, half the English <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>honey-crop is lost for want of bees
to gather it.&nbsp; If, therefore, the new system of plurality of
queens both justifies and establishes itself, the near future may
see a revolution in all ideas relating to beemanship.&nbsp; All
that can be said for certain at present is that as many as five
queens have been induced to occupy the same hive in peace and
quiet together; but whether this portentous state of affairs can
remain a lasting one is still to be proved.</p>
<p>A curious and, to the expert, a startling outcome of these
efforts to break down an old and almost universal custom in
bee-life, is that the successful establishment of several
mother-bees in a single hive appears to lessen the swarming
impulse.&nbsp; Hives so treated do not send out a swarm so far as
is known.&nbsp; One of the most disappointing experiences in
bee-craft is to see prosperous stocks breaking themselves up into
several hopelessly weak detachments just before the great
honey-flow, when strength of numbers is the one vital thing; and
if plurality of queens will prevent this vexatious evil, the old
time-honoured custom is sure to go.</p>
<p>The student of bee-life, watching the year�s work in the
hive from its earliest beginnings, and marking its steady,
cautious development, will readily see how the ancient idea of
the mother-bee�s absolute monarchy gained its vogue.&nbsp;
The deception of appearances is all but complete.&nbsp; <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Right in the
heart of the winter-cluster he sees the queen bestirring herself
to lay the first eggs, and the bees around her slowly awakening
to the duty before them.&nbsp; With the passing of the weeks, he
sees the brood-area steadily enlarging; the hitherto close-packed
throng of workers gradually extending itself over a larger space
of comb; the water-fetchers increasingly busy; the
pollen-gathering bees already at work in the crocus-borders of
the garden, where the year�s first gold and white and
purple is gaily flaunting in the sun.&nbsp; He notes that the
progress of the colony within the warm hive does not go by the
calendar, but checks with each return of cold, and forges ahead
only when the spring seems to be coming in right good
earnest.&nbsp; He sees, even now, when February is waning and the
hazel-catkins fill the bare woodland with a shimmer of emerald,
that the colony still husbands its stores, eking them out with a
long-sighted parsimony that shall be more than justified when the
inevitable cold break comes in the flowery midst of the English
May.&nbsp; It is impossible to overlook the evidence of a wise,
directing mind through it all; and where should this be seated
but in the brain of the single large bee, courted and fed and
groomed unceasingly by the attendant host around her�she
who is the teeming mother of past tens of thousands, and who
carries in her body the seed of all the generations to come?</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Yet the
truth is that the queen-bee is the very reverse of a monarch,
both by nature and inclination.&nbsp; She possesses only the
merest rudiment of intelligence.&nbsp; She has a magnificent
body, great docility, certain almost unrestrainable impulse and
passions, a yielding, womanish love of the yoke; but she is
incapable of action other than that arising from her bodily
promptings.&nbsp; Her brain is much smaller than that of the
worker.&nbsp; In a dozen different ways she is inferior to the
common worker-bees, who rule her absolutely, mapping out her
entire daily life and using her for the good of the colony, just
as a delicate, costly piece of mechanism is used by human
craftsmen to produce some necessary article of trade.</p>
<p>In a word, the queen is the sole surviving representative of
the aboriginal female honey-bee.&nbsp; The aborted females, the
workers, are almost as much a product of civilisation as the
human race itself.</p>
<p>Every step of the way now, in a study of the life of the bee,
is hedged about with wonders.&nbsp; It is seen that the common
worker-bee is raised in a cell allowing her only the barest
minimum of space for development, while the queen has an
apartment twice as long as she can possibly need.&nbsp; The
worker-cells are so designed that as many a possible may be
contained in a given area, and their construction involve the
least possible amount of material.&nbsp; Therefore these cells
are made in the <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>form of a hexagon, this being the only shape approaching
the cylindrical�the ideal form�of which a number will
fit together over a plane surface without leaving useless spaces
in between.&nbsp; Moreover, the cells needing to be closed at the
bottom, half the material required for this purpose is saved by
the device of placing the sheets of combined hexagons back to
back, so that one base will serve for two cells.&nbsp; But it is
not only in the construction of the cradles of the worker-bees
that rigid economy is practised.&nbsp; From the moment that the
egg hatches until the young grub changes into the chrysalis
state, it is given only the smallest quantity of food that will
support life and allow necessary development.</p>
<p>In the case of the young queen-larva, however, a very
different policy is instituted from the beginning.&nbsp; Not only
is she given nursery-quarters allowing every facility for growth,
but she is loaded with a specially rich kind of food night and
day, until she actually swims in it.&nbsp; The nurse-bees are
constantly pouring this glistening white substance into the cell
for the whole five days of her larval existence, and the effect
of this generous diet is obvious from the first in her more rapid
growth, as compared with the worker-bee.&nbsp; A further
advantage still is that the young queen has perfectly free access
to the air at all stages of her development.&nbsp; The
worker-cell is but sparsely ventilated, and that only through the
narrow top, <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>all its six sides and base being absolutely
impervious.&nbsp; But the cradle-cell of the queen is not only
made of a porous material throughout, but it is commonly placed
at the edge of the comb, where it stand out in the full current
of ventilation, the air percolating the whole substance of its
walls in addition to entering freely at the large
cell-mouth.&nbsp; Thus the main cause of the extraordinary
difference in the development of the queen-bee and the worker is
that of treatment; the one being given unlimited rich food and
oxygen and room to grow in, the other receiving only meagre
workhouse diet, restricted quarters, and little air to
breathe.</p>
<p>Yet, making every allowance for the stimulating or retarding
effect of these agencies on the young female grub, we are still
hardly any nearer to solution of the mystery.&nbsp; We are
compelled to believe that the egg which produces the worker is
identical in its nature with that from which is evolved the
queen-bee, because a simple experiment will at once dispel all
doubt on the matter.&nbsp; If the egg deposited in the queen-cell
be removed and an egg taken from any one of the thousand of
worker-cells in a hive be put in its place, the worker-egg will
always produce a fully developed and accoutred queen-bee.&nbsp;
On the other hand, if an egg be taken from a queen-cell and
placed in a worker-cell, it will as infallibly hatch out into a
common undersized worker.&nbsp; It would be sufficient tax on the
credibility if the differences of queen <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>and worker
were only those of degree.&nbsp; If the queen were nothing but a
large-sized worker-bee, in whom certain organs�which were
atrophied in the worker�had received their full
development, it would be a fact within comprehension; but the
queen differs from the worker not only in size and the capability
of her organism, but also on several important points of
structure.&nbsp; And how can mere food and air and circumstance
produce structural change?&nbsp; The worker has many bodily
appliances, special members ingeniously adapted to her daily
tasks, of which the queen is wholly destitute; while the physical
organism of the queen varies from that of the worker in several
important degrees.</p>
<p>Some of these must be enumerated.&nbsp; The abdomen of the
worker is comparatively short and rounded: that of the queen is
larger and longer, and comes to a fairly sharp point.&nbsp; The
jaws of the queen are notched on their inner cutting edge: the
worker�s jaws are smooth like the edge of a knife.&nbsp;
The tongue of the worker has a spatula at its extremity, and is
furnished with sensitive hairs: the tongue of the queen is
shorter, the spatula is smaller, while the hairs show greater
length.&nbsp; The worker-bee has a complicated system of
wax-secreting discs under the horny plates of her abdomen: in the
queen these are absent, nor can the most elementary trace of them
be discovered.&nbsp; In their nerve-systems the two show <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>difference,
the queen possessing only four abdominal ganglia, while the
worker has five.&nbsp; The queen�s sting is curved, and
longer than the worker�s: the sting of the worker-bee is
perfectly straight.&nbsp; On their hind-legs the workers have a
curious contrivance which bee-keepers have named the
pollen-basket.&nbsp; It is a hollowing of the thigh, the cavity
being surrounded with stiff hairs; and within this the pollen is
packed and carried home to the hive.&nbsp; In the queen both the
cavity and the hairs are absent.&nbsp; Her colour also is
generally different from that of the worker-bee, her legs, in
particular, being a much redder brown.</p>
<p>Here is a problem for our great biologists�a problem,
however, at which the plain, every-day man may well flinch.&nbsp;
For we seem to have come face to face with new principles of
organic life, facts incompatible with the accepted ideas of the
inevitable relation between cause and effect.&nbsp; The
irresistible tendency at this stage is to hark back; to repeat
the experiment of the transposed eggs, and see whether no vital,
initial circumstance has been overlooked.&nbsp; But the result is
always the same.&nbsp; Nor can the most careful microscopical
dissection of the eggs themselves reveal any differences.&nbsp;
In this mystery of the structural variance between queen and
worker, it would seem that we are forced to accept one of three
alternatives.&nbsp; Either the egg contains two distinct germs of
life, one developing only under the stress of hard times, <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the other
only to the call of luxury.&nbsp; Or we must go back to
medi�val notions, and believe that the worker-bees give or
withhold some vital principle of their own during nurturing
operations.&nbsp; Or we must give up the problem, and decide that
creation works on lines very different from those on which we
have hitherto grounded our faith.</p>
<p>The difficulty is further complicated by the fact that this
change of nature does not take place until relatively late in the
life of the bee.&nbsp; The egg is three days in hatching.&nbsp;
But the young larva is at least three more days old before nature
has made the irrevocable step along either of the divergent
ways.&nbsp; For the experiment of transposition can be made with
exactly the same result if undertaken with female bee-larv�
not more than three days old, instead of the unhatched
eggs.&nbsp; Indeed, this is an operation that the nurse-bees
themselves perform, on occasion.&nbsp; If a hive loses its queen,
and it happens that all the eggs in the worker-cells are hatched
out, the bees will breed another queen from any one of the
worker-larva available.&nbsp; This is generally successful when
the young grub has not passed the three days� limit.&nbsp;
But, even when all the larv� of the hive are older than
this, the bees will still attempt the task, knowing well that,
without a queen, the colony must perish.&nbsp; In this case,
however, the resulting queen will be defective in various
ways.&nbsp; Probably she will never be capable of fertilisation,
and therefore the breed of <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>worker-bees will be cut off at its
source.&nbsp; Unless the bee-master supplies the colony with a
new queen, properly fecundated, the hive will gradually fill up
with drones, the old worker-bees will die off, and the stock must
ultimately become extinct.</p>
<p>When once the study of the inner life of the honey-bee has
been undertaken, the watcher will soon realise that he has
embarked on a stranger voyage than he ever contemplated, even in
his most daring moments.&nbsp; In the old bee-garden there was a
serenity, a quiet enduring bliss of ignorance, that chimed in
well with his slothful, holiday mood.&nbsp; The sunshine, the
flowers, the song of the wind in the tree-tops, and the drowsy
song of the hives; the voice of the old white-headed cottager
weaving in his listener�s ear the old, comfortable
arabesque of error; the sudden, jubilant uproar of a swarm,
filling the blue sky with music and the flash of unnumbered
wings; the night-quiet, with its deep underground bee-murmur, its
dim half-moon peering over the hill-top, the shadowy bent figure
of the old beeman listening at hive-doors for the battle-cry of
rival queens, that should mean trouble on the morrow�it all
comes back to the watcher now as a haven he has left
inconsiderately, for a voyage over unknown, stormy seas.&nbsp;
For now, with the inner life of the hive going on unmasked before
his very eyes, wonder succeeds wonder almost without a break; and
each new fact that reveals itself is more perturbing, <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>because
more destructive of old, hallowed convention, than any that has
gone before.</p>
<p>The hive that has lost its mother-bee, and failed to provide
her with a fully developed, fertile successor, is seen to be
rapidly declining in its worker-population, while the horde of
drones is increasing at a greater rate than ever.&nbsp; But where
do these drones come from, if the very fount of bee-life has been
dried up at its source by the loss of a fertilised queen?&nbsp;
The question brings the student to what is perhaps the most
remarkable fact in the whole great book of natural history.</p>
<p>We are not concerned, for the moment, with theological
matters; nor will the thread of the story of the honey-bee be
laid down, however briefly, for an excursion into the
pulpit.&nbsp; Yet here is something that may well give
wherewithal for thought.&nbsp; For nearly two thousand years the
Doctrine of the Virgin Birth has been the centre of a bitter
human controversy.&nbsp; Its liegemen uphold it as a main article
of faith, eternally exalted from the odious need of proof; its
temperate opposers sadly and quietly set it aside as a natural
impossibility.&nbsp; On one side the charge is want of faith; on
the other of blind credulity.&nbsp; And yet no one seems to have
thought of looking into paths of creation other than human, to
see if no parallel exists that may help both sides, and send the
swords to sheath before a common mystery.&nbsp; The honey-bee is
small among the fowls, but here she looms large in the world, a
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>portentous symbol.&nbsp; It is a fact, now
incontestably proved, that the virgin queen-bee is capable of
reproducing her kind, yet only the male of the species.&nbsp; If
she is born late in the year, when no drones exist, and her
fertilisation is therefore impossible, or if some imperfection of
wing prevents her going out for her mating-flight, she will still
set busily to work at her one function of egg-laying; and these
eggs will all hatch out into male bees.&nbsp; The same thing
occurs in the case of the queenless hive, which, having neither
worker-egg nor worker-grub, whose age is under the three
days� limit, yet tries to raise a new queen from a larva
perhaps four or even five days old.&nbsp; The queen thus created
is queen only in name.&nbsp; She may have her ovaries completely
developed, but otherwise she will be congenitally
destitute.&nbsp; She will have neither the will nor power to
receive the drone; and the eggs that she lays so industriously
only add to the crowd of useless males that will soon be the sole
representatives of the doomed household.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>Following the progress of a bee-colony through the
mounting days of spring, we see, with every week that passes, a
larger area of comb occupied by the young worker-brood; while
about the middle of April the queen pays her first visit to the
drone-combs, laying a single egg in each cell, as with the
rest.&nbsp; It is commonly supposed that the queen is always
surrounded by an adulatory retinue, each attendant bee keeping
her head respectfully towards her sovereign, and backing before
her as she progresses over the combs.&nbsp; Something of this
sort is constantly seen during breeding-time, but at other
seasons the queen ordinarily receives little attention, passing
to and fro in the hive with no more ceremony than is bestowed on
any other of the bees.&nbsp; The medi�val writers were
aware that the queen had these attendants, and believed them
always to be twelve in number, representing the twelve
Apostles.&nbsp; A little observation, however, will soon make it
clear that the bees which surround the queen on her egg-laying
journeys are neither devotees nor courtiers.&nbsp; They are
actually her guides, her keepers.&nbsp; The queen�s
movements are all prompted by the incessant strokings and
pushings and gentle touches of the antenn� that she
receives from these.&nbsp; Thus they allow her free passage over
the combs, but stop her at each vacant cell, gathering close
about her, evidently with the most absorbing anxiety and interest
in the operation.&nbsp; First, she peers into the cell, examining
it carefully.&nbsp; Then she rears; the bees give way before her;
she takes a step or two onward until the end of her body is over
the cell.&nbsp; And then she thrusts her abdomen deep into it,
pauses a moment, mounts again upon the comb, and the attendant
bees at once resume charge of her, and man�uvre her towards
the next empty cell.&nbsp; This process never <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>seems
hurried, and yet in the height of the breeding season it must go
on at an extraordinary pace.&nbsp; It is well attested that a
good queen will thus furnish as many as two thousand to three
thousand cells in a day, which gives an average of two eggs a
minute, even supposing her to keep at the work without pause for
the whole twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The cells designed to contain the worker-brood measure
one-fifth of an inch across the mouth; drone cells are larger,
having a diameter of a quarter-inch, as well as greater
depth.&nbsp; The queen may pass from one species of comb to the
other, but she seldom makes a mistake.&nbsp; The egg deposited in
the worker-cell hatches out a female; that which is laid in the
larger cell becomes a drone, or male bee.&nbsp; Obviously the
deposition of the different kinds of eggs is well under the
control of the queen.&nbsp; It will be also seen that not only
does the mother bee lay either male or female eggs at will, but
their number also is subject to her discrimination.&nbsp; From
the time when she begins ovipositing, until she reaches her
period of greatest activity in early summer, the increase of the
colony is not regular, but goes by fits and starts according to
the weather, or the amount of incoming food.&nbsp; If the new
honey is steadily mounting up in the storehouse, and pollen is
plentiful, the work of brood-raising will go freely ahead; but if
unseasonable cold stops the work of the foragers, this will
immediately affect the output of <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the queen, and under exceptionally
adverse conditions egg-laying may be entirely arrested.&nbsp;
This may also take place in the height of the season, and in full
favour of sunshine and plenty, if the hive is a small one, and
the limit of its capacity has been reached.&nbsp; The combs will
then be full of either honey or brood, and the queen must wait
until laying space can be cleared for her.&nbsp; That she is able
to do this�that her powers can be augmented or restrained,
according to the needs of the colony, and that the proportion of
the sexes in the hive can be varied at will to suit like
contingencies�can only be understood when the details of
her life-history have been passed under review.</p>
<p>In the normal, prosperous colony, which we are now studying,
the queen will be in her prime, and under natural conditions will
remain at the head of affairs until she goes out with the first
swarm in May or June.&nbsp; A queen-bee is at the zenith of her
fecundity in the second year of her life.&nbsp; After that, her
egg-laying powers steadily decline, although she may live to be
four, or even five, years old.&nbsp; But the authorities in a
hive rarely allow a mother-bee to retain her position after she
has shown signs of waning energy.&nbsp; Preparations are at once
set on foot for the raising of another queen.</p>
<p>A very old queen will have lost her power to lay worker-eggs,
and will have become nothing <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>but a drone-breeder.&nbsp; But the
bees are seldom caught napping in this way.&nbsp; Long before
this happens the building of the royal cells will have commenced
in the hive.&nbsp; A queen-cell has been likened, by various
writers, to an acorn, and when half completed it bears a very
close resemblance, both in size and shape, to an inverted
acorn-cup.&nbsp; This is commonly hung mouth downwards at the
side or base of one of the central brood-combs, but it may be
placed right in the middle of the comb, in which case the cells
around it are cut away to give it air and space.&nbsp; Whether
the old queen herself deposits the egg in the royal
cell�thus unwittingly supplying the means for her own
future dethronement�or whether the worker-bees transfer to
it an egg or grub from a common cell, is not yet finally
ascertained.&nbsp; As, however, the mere sight of a royal cell
usually excites the queen to fury, the chances are that she is
never allowed to approach it at any time, and the egg would then
be placed there by the worker-bees.&nbsp; But, in the great
majority of cases, it is probable that new queens are raised by
enlarging an already existing worker-cell, in which an egg has
been previously deposited.&nbsp; As far as is known, this is
always the case when a young grub is used for the purpose instead
of an egg.&nbsp; It is possible, also, that the queen is
physically incapable of laying in a royal cell an egg that will
produce a female bee; but this curious point will be touched upon
at a later stage.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>The
old trite saying among beemen, that bees never do anything
invariably, receives constant illustration in any near study of
the ways of the honey-bee.&nbsp; It has been seen that a colony
deprived of its queen, and having no worker-egg or grub less than
three days old wherewith to make good its deficiency, is commonly
doomed to early extinction.&nbsp; But, on rare occasions,
colonies supposed to be in this plight will make an unexpected
and inexplicable recovery.&nbsp; After a period of the doldrums,
extending for three weeks or more, a sudden renewed activity and
exhilaration is observable in the hive.&nbsp; The pollen-bearers,
who have been hitherto almost idle, resume their busy work; and,
on the hive being opened, all the evidences of the presence of a
fertile, laying queen-mother are again to be seen.&nbsp; In many
instances in which a new lease of life has thus been vouchsafed
to a colony under what seems an inexorable ban, no doubt
appearances have been deceptive.&nbsp; The bees may have
discovered in their midst a worker-larva not yet too far advanced
for promotion to queenship, and thus have achieved their
salvation at the eleventh hour.&nbsp; But, in at least one case,
the testimony against the possibility of this seems
complete.&nbsp; A nucleus stock, containing only three or four
small combs and only about five hundred bees, was deprived of its
queen.&nbsp; Ten days later every queen-cell that had been formed
in the interval was destroyed, leaving in the hive not a single
egg <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>or
bee in the larval state.&nbsp; Nevertheless, on the hive being
opened after a further period of eighteen days, one new
queen-cell containing an egg was discovered.&nbsp; And this egg
duly hatched out into a fine, well-developed queen-bee.&nbsp;
Assuming the facts to be true, and they seem to be
incontrovertible, there is only one inference to be drawn from
this: some enterprising bee of the colony must have gone to
another hive and either begged, borrowed, or stolen a
worker-egg.&nbsp; Apiarian scientists very rightly hesitate to
ascribe to the honey-bee surpassing ingenuity of this kind on the
testimony of a single case, however well authenticated.&nbsp; But
other instances are on record nearly as indubitable, and as it is
an unquestioned fact that worker-bees will carry eggs about from
comb to comb within the space of their own hive, it does not seem
wholly incredible that they may visit other hives in the
immediate neighbourhood, especially when impelled to extra
resourcefulness by so vital a need.&nbsp; The whole question is
interesting in more ways than one, as it seems to bear very
trenchantly on the problem of �Reason versus
Instinct,� now busy in the thoughts of most modern
naturalists.</p>
<p>In whatever way the egg for the queen-cell may be furnished by
the stock intending to raise a new mother-bee, the first sign of
life is always the same�a tiny, white, elongated speck,
glued on end to the base, or what must rather be called <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the roof,
of the inverted cell-cup.&nbsp; In this state it remains about
three days, when the larva hatches out, and at once the special
treatment accorded to the young queen begins.&nbsp; She is loaded
with rich provender from the first moment of her existence,
living literally up to the eyes in the white, shining, jelly-like
substance that the nurse-bees are continually regurgitating and
pouring into the cells.&nbsp; This superfeeding process is
continued for about five days, when the larva has reached its
full growth and the cell its greatest dimensions.&nbsp; The larva
then stops feeding to spin itself a silken shroud before changing
into the pupa state, and the bees seal up the door of the
cell.&nbsp; In its completed state the cell loses its resemblance
to an acorn, and is rather to be likened to a fir-cone.&nbsp; In
the case of the common workers and drones, the cells are made of
pure wax, only the capping being of mingled wax and pollen; but
the queen cell is constructed throughout of this porous
material.</p>
<p>The fully grown queen-bee is ready, and more than anxious to
leave her cradle-cell in about fifteen or sixteen days after the
laying of the egg.&nbsp; The bees, however, generally give her a
first lesson in obedience even at this early point in her
career.&nbsp; It is a critical time in the history of the hive,
and much thought and care have been bestowed on the complicated
business in hand.&nbsp; In the first place, it would never have
done to <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>allow the whole future welfare of the colony to depend
on a single life alone.&nbsp; Therefore not one queen has been
raised, but several.&nbsp; As many as five or six queens may be
ready to hatch out in different parts of the brood-nest, and none
of them will be permitted to break from her cell until the
appointed time arrives.&nbsp; For each the cradle now becomes a
prison.&nbsp; A small hole is bored in the cell-wall, through
which the impatient captive is fed, pending the day when she is
to be allowed her liberty; and close guard and watch is kept over
each cell to save it from the violence of the old queen, who is
becoming hourly more restless and suspicious.</p>
<p>The complete subjection of the mother-bee to the ruling
worker-class in the hive receives here a striking
confirmation.&nbsp; She is a true exemplar of a prevailing kind
of femininity�comely of person, untutored in mind, an
inveterate stay-at-home, a prolific mother; and now there awakens
in her the sounding chord of jealousy.&nbsp; Left free to act on
her own impulses, she would soon bring about a speedy end to all
the careful, long-sighted preparations within the hive.&nbsp; She
would tear open each royal cell, and with one thrust of the
curved, cruel scimitar that queen-bees use only on their equals
in rank, its occupant would be ruthlessly despatched, and her own
supremacy reinstated.&nbsp; But an impassable barrier stops the
way�the collective will of the hive.&nbsp; The violent
delight <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>of killing has once been hers; she will never know it
again.&nbsp; Now her own fate is in the balance.&nbsp; It may be
death, or a new life in a new home: all depends on the deliberate
decree of those who have made her, and who now use or discard
her, for their own purposes.&nbsp; If it be late spring, and the
condition of the stock warrant it, this governing spirit may
decide for colonisation, and the old queen may be disposed of by
sending her off with a swarm.&nbsp; But other counsels may
prevail.&nbsp; The times may be unripe, or the weather
inopportune.&nbsp; And then Fate, in the shape of a merciless
application of principles, will descend upon her, and her own
wise children will ruthlessly put her to death.</p>
<p>This State-execution of the queen, at the first sign of waning
fertility, is a peculiarly pathetic as well as a tragic phase of
bee-life.&nbsp; The stern, soured amazons of the hive must have
their systems and conventions in everything they undertake; and
they cannot even bring about the supersession of the old queen
without due circumstance and ceremonial.&nbsp; Given that it
would be against the best interests of the common weal that she
should retain her life after the loss of her queenhood, one swift
stroke would immediately determine the matter, and the
law�that there shall be no useless members in the
bee-republic�would have its due fulfilment.&nbsp; But old
tradition rules that the queen shall suffer no violence from <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>the weapons
of the common herd.&nbsp; She is to die, but her death must be
brought about in another way.&nbsp; And so the fawning
executioners gather round her, locking her in an embrace that
tightens with every moment, until the breath is literally hugged
out of her body.&nbsp; All her life has been spent in the midst
of caresses, and now she is to die of them, close held to the
last in that silent, terrible grip.</p>

117</span>CHAPTER VIII<br>
<span class="GutSmall">THE BRIDE-WIDOW</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the heat and glow of the fine
June morning you may see her, the young virgin queen, making
ready for her nuptial flight.</p>
<p>At first she is all hesitancy; wandering to and fro amidst the
crowd on the hive-threshold; coquetting with the sunshine; loath
to return to the dim, pent, murmurous twilight she has forsaken,
yet hardly daring to launch herself on wings that are still
untried.</p>
<p>For three long days and nights since her release from the
prison-cell she has been a curiously solitary figure in the busy
throng within the hive.&nbsp; Instead of the enthusiastic,
welcoming world she expected, she finds none but unregarding
strangers about her.&nbsp; Not a drone glances her way, and the
worker-bees go upon their business in seeming unconcern at her
presence.&nbsp; They do not even trouble themselves to feed her,
and she is left to forage for herself as best she may.&nbsp; A
conspiracy of indifference is on the clan�all part of a
deep design for her education, if she only <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>knew it,
but singularly damping to the ardours, and great ideas of
destiny, that gather within her day by day.&nbsp; At length the
call comes for which all are secretly waiting, and obeying
irresistibly, she presses out into the light.</p>
<p>As she stands hesitating, the hot June sun falls upon her,
laving her in molten gold.&nbsp; The blue sky beckons her
upward.&nbsp; All the world of colour and incense and life calls
her to her wooing, and she must needs obey.&nbsp; With a little
glad flutter of the wings, she breaks at last from the scrambling
company about her, and soars up into the light.</p>
<p>Warily now she hovers, taking careful stock of her home and
its surroundings.&nbsp; Then round and round, in ever widening
and lifting circles, each sweep upward giving her a broader view
of the world that lies beyond.&nbsp; And then away into the blue
sky so swiftly that no human eye can follow; yet only for a short
flight.&nbsp; She is back again now, almost before you have
missed her, and hurrying, frightened at her own audacity, into
the old safe gloom of the hive.</p>
<p>Thus she dallies, to and fro between the sunshine and the
darkness, each time adventuring a little farther into the blue
playground of the upper air, until at length the inevitable comes
to pass.&nbsp; A great drone�one of the roistering crowd
that fills the bee-garden with its hoarse noontide
music�spies her, and gives instant chase.&nbsp; At sight of
him she wheels, and darts away into the <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>sunshine at
lightning speed.&nbsp; Yet the first drone has hardly stretched a
wing before another is after him, and still another.&nbsp; Thick
and fast from all points they gather for the race, until the
fleeing queen has drawn a whole bevy of them, streaming like a
little grey cloud behind her.&nbsp; This much you can see as you
strain your eyes in their track; but in a moment quarry and
huntsmen have vanished together, volleying, as it seemed,
straight up into the farthermost skies.</p>
<p>From her birth to the day when that terrible, living cordon
closes about her, almost the whole life of the queen-bee can be
followed step by step.&nbsp; Only this one moment of her bridal
stands unrevealed, and perhaps for ever unrevealable, to human
eyes.&nbsp; You can picture to yourself the wild chevy-chase
through the clear June air and sunshine; you can give, in fancy,
the prize to the strongest and the fleetest; but all you will
know for certain is that in a little while the queen returns to
the hive, sobered and solitary, trailing behind her infallible
evidence of her impregnation and the death of the victorious
drone.&nbsp; She has been the bride of a moment; now she is to be
the widow of a lifetime.&nbsp; Henceforward her days are to be
spent in the twilight cloisters of the hive, flying abroad so
rarely that many an old experienced beeman will say she comes
forth only once a year when she leads a swarm.&nbsp; But in her
body now she carries the seed from which will spring up a <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>whole
nation.&nbsp; Before her marriage-flight she was the least
considered of all the colony; now she is welcomed home with
public ovation; lauded, fed, and fondled; set up in the high
place, a living symbol of the tens of thousands unborn.&nbsp; As
in olden, savage times, the royal festivals had their human
sacrifices, so this paramount day in the perfected communism of
the bee-people must vent its rejoicing in slaughter.&nbsp; But it
is not tribute of common slaves that is now to redden the
State-shambles, nor will the work fall to the common
executioner�s knife.&nbsp; There are captive queens in the
citadel�a royal sacrifice ready to hand, and a royal blade
hungering for the task.&nbsp; Once the queen has proved her
intrinsic motherhood, and the first few worker-eggs have been
laid in the comb, the guards will stand away from the royal
prison-cells and let her wreak her will upon them.&nbsp; It is
all very ghastly in a miniature way, yet very queenly, as old
traditions of human queenhood go.&nbsp; She gives over her
nursery-work gladly enough for a moment, and flies to the
slaughter, tearing down the prison-doors, and putting each
clamorous captive fiercely to the sword.</p>
<p>Apart from this tragic element of sororicide, quickly over and
soon forgotten in the general rejoicing, there is true romance in
the early life-story of the Queen of the Bees�bridehood,
wifehood, widowhood, following hard upon each other, all in the
space of a single hour.&nbsp; But in the <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>details of
her common everyday life that succeed this tense period, above
all in the wonderful structure of her body and its functions,
there is greater romance still.&nbsp; That she has but a single
commerce with the drone, and thereafter is exalted to perpetual
fecundity; that, through her, sons and daughters can be given to
the hive in just the proportion needed for the good of the State,
or that increase of population can be wholly arrested at will,
are facts to be accredited only after sure knowledge.&nbsp; And
to understand how these results are brought about, it is
necessary to learn something of the anatomy, as well as the
manner of fecundation, of the mother-bee.</p>
<p>In the first place, as fertilisation of the one sex by the
other is usually regarded, the queen-bee is not fertilised at
all.&nbsp; The vital essence of the drone does not penetrate the
ovaries of the queen, but passes immediately after coition into a
receptacle specially provided for it, where it is stored, and its
effectiveness preserved, during nearly the whole lifetime of the
queen.&nbsp; It has been shown that the virgin queen is able to
lay eggs from which only drones, or male bees, originate.&nbsp;
The fecundated queen, however, can lay both male and female eggs,
and she has the power of depositing either kind when and wherever
she wills.&nbsp; The whole thing, amazing as it is, and
far-reaching in its results, has, like many other extraordinary
devices in nature, a simple explanation.&nbsp; The <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>gland
wherein is stored the male life-essence, can be opened or closed
at the will of the mother-bee, or rather, as will be shown,
according to circumstances that for the moment involuntarily but
inexorably guide her.&nbsp; When she is brought to the large
drone-cell, this gland remains shut, and the egg escapes without
contact with its contents.&nbsp; But at the narrow worker-cells
the gland in the oviduct is opened, and the egg, in passing,
absorbs some of its containing germs.&nbsp; Thus only the female
bee is born of the union of the two parents; the male bee is the
offspring of mother alone.</p>
<p>Of this primal incident, the parthenogenesis, or birth of the
fully equipped male from the virgin female, little more can be
said than that it is a well-ascertained fact of nature,
exemplified in several other insects beside the honey-bee.&nbsp;
But while we are witnessing the part played in the hive by the
fecundated queen, with her elaborate organism, much is to be
noted; and here we really get the master-key to a right
understanding of the whole system of bee-government.&nbsp; It
would be an anomaly if the highest, most important functions of
the State had been entrusted solely to the queen, whose feeble
intelligence renders her, of all others, least likely to execute
them properly; and we find, in fact, that no such reliance is
placed on her.&nbsp; The worker-bees, who take her in charge on
her return from her mating-flight, henceforth originate <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>her every
act and impulse.&nbsp; It has already been seen how she is led
from cell to cell over the combs; how she is caused to lay, in
earliest spring, only a few eggs a day, while in the summer she
may produce several thousand; and how her output may be checked
or augmented at any point between.&nbsp; Now we are to realise
how it is all brought about; or, at least, bring conjecture as
near to certainty as may be with so difficult a theme.</p>
<p>During the first two days of her life as a perfect insect, we
saw the young virgin queen mingling with the throng in the hive
almost unnoticed, and left to seek her own food from the common
store like the rest.&nbsp; But now that her fecundation has been
achieved, she has a whole suite of chamber-women, whose principal
duty is to attend to her nourishment.&nbsp; From their mouths
they feed her, giving her, in all probability, the same rich
substance that was administered to her when but a larva in the
cell.&nbsp; This bee-milk consists mainly of honey and pollen
pre-digested, but it has been proved that its composition can be
altered at will by the ministering bees.&nbsp; Additions to it
are made, either separately, or combined in varying proportions,
from three or four distinct glands, each of which exudes a liquid
differing in nature from that of the rest.&nbsp; The particular
kind of nourishment given to a queen who is to be urged on in the
work of egg-laying, has the effect of stimulating <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>her
ovaries.&nbsp; The more food of this kind she receives, the
greater will be her prolificacy.&nbsp; On the other hand, a
diminishing allowance will mean a corresponding decrease in her
egg-laying powers; while, if this rich diet be withheld
altogether, and she is forced to help herself from the
honey-cells, the development of these eggs may cease entirely, as
it actually does in the coldest time of the year.&nbsp; Thus the
bees play upon her, producing just the music needed for their
purposes.&nbsp; As the days lengthen, and the spring sun gets
higher and warmer, they gradually waken her docile nature to its
one paramount task.&nbsp; In the flaming weeks of summer she sits
at an unending banquet.&nbsp; And when autumn comes, with its
chilly nights and steadily failing sun-glow, the generous fare is
slowly withdrawn; her retinue thins and disperses; at length she
becomes a solitary, unmarked wanderer again, sipping, with the
commonest worker, at the plain household sweets.</p>
<p>How the proportion of the sexes is so unerringly regulated by
the hive-authorities through their influence on the mother-bee,
is not so readily explained; nor can it be at present more than
shrewd conjecture, a backward reckoning from effect to
cause.&nbsp; Probably the opening or closing of the fertilising
gland, which decides the sex of the egg, is automatic, the
attitude of the mother-bee during oviposition determining its
action.&nbsp; When she enters the narrow worker-cells, her body
is <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>necessarily straightened, and this may produce pressure
on the fecundating gland, resulting in the impregnation of the
egg.&nbsp; But in the wider drone-cell no such constricted
posture is needful, and the egg may therefore pass untouched by
the fructifying germ.&nbsp; If this version of the matter be
accepted, the natural inference is that either the mother-bee is
incapable of laying female eggs in the cells specially
constructed for raising queens�these being the largest of
all,�or that there is something in the peculiar curve of
the cell-cup which compels her to straighten her body in the act,
and so brings about the same posture as with the narrow
worker-cells.</p>
<p>This theory, although at present the most plausible, has
received, it is true, little confirmation in fact.&nbsp; No one,
apparently, has ever seen the mother-bee lay in a queen-cell, nor
has the transportation thither of a worker-egg by the bees
actually been witnessed.&nbsp; To cling to the old idea of the
supremacy of the queen-bee, giving her the power and ability of a
despotic, all-wise sovereign, would, of course, set this and many
other vexed questions at rest.&nbsp; Nothing, however marvellous,
would be too much to expect of her.&nbsp; But the farther the
student of bee-life goes in his absorbing subject, the more
impossible the old notion seems.&nbsp; Proof comes to him with
every hour that the mother-bee is virtually a servant, and never
a ruler in the hive; and just as assured testimony reaches <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>him of the
universal potency of the worker-bees.&nbsp; All else that takes
place within the hive is brought about by their collective will
and agency; and it would be strange indeed if this vital matter
of progeneration were not subject to the same controlling
force.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE SOVEREIGN WORKER-BEE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Watching</span> the inner life of the hive
in the season of its full activity, it is not the untiring spirit
of industry pervading the whole bee-commonwealth that most
excites the student�s wonder, but rather the fact that this
ceaseless diligence finds so many outlets�that so many
different kinds of necessary work are going forward at one and
the same time.</p>
<p>Between the brood-combs the nurses are feeding the young
larv�, or clearing out the empty cells, or sealing over the
full-grown nymphs for their pre-natal slumber.&nbsp; Hard by, the
sowers are at their vital work, driving their living seed-barrow,
the queen, over the combs.&nbsp; Elsewhere the wax-makers hang in
a silent, densely packed cluster.&nbsp; Overhead, the new
honey-combs are growing; the masons building up the cell-walls,
while the engineers devise means and ends, calculate strains, put
in a strut here, a stay there, or flying buttress from one comb
to another, or cut new <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>passageways where the traffic seems
too congested for the old thoroughfares of the hive.</p>
<p>On all sides the scavenging bees go to and fro, picking up
every particle of refuse, and carrying it safely away.&nbsp;
Winged undertakers drive their trade in the midst of the throng,
bearing the corpses of their comrades, old and young, towards the
entrance, and flying away with them into the sunlight of the
young spring day.&nbsp; There is the ventilating army outside the
city gates, skilfully organised in relays, so that, day and
night, a constant circulation of air is maintained.&nbsp; There
are the guard-bees close by, watching all in-comers and
out-goers.&nbsp; There is a sort of General Purposes Committee
ready outside the threshold with a helping hand for all:
succouring the overladen, grooming down any in need of such
assistance, gathering up fallen treasure, or, as it would seem,
taking careful note of the weather for their next official
report.&nbsp; And all through the hours of sunshine, in
unnumbered thousands, the foragers are charging to and fro, some
bringing nectar, some staggering in under mighty loads of pollen,
others with full water-sacs, still more dragging behind them
lumps of the curious cement called by the ancients Propolis, and
used for so many different purposes in the daily work of the
hive.</p>

<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>And
it all goes on with the regularity of a well ordered human
settlement.&nbsp; There is complexity, yet no confusion; there is
speed without hurry Each busy gang of labourers has apparently a
distinct and definite task allotted to it by the central
hive-authority; co-operation and progress are, to all
appearances, deified cause and effect in all the affairs of the
hive.</p>
<p>It is easy�nay, inevitable�in any close study of
bee-life with the help of the modern observation-hive, to overset
the ancient idea of absolute bee-monarchy under a single king or
queen.&nbsp; But it is not so easy to determine how the general
government of the colony is actually carried on.&nbsp;
Innumerable small consultations on minor matters are seen to take
place on every side during each moment of the busy day; but
nothing like general communication is ever visible.&nbsp; And
yet, how are the great national movements, such as the despatch
of a swarm or the supersedure of an old queen, brought about; how
are the various common crises of the State met, and provided
for?&nbsp; The only rational inference seems to be that each
worker is in herself the perfect evolved presentment of
republicanism, in whom all imaginable difficulties in collective
life have their best solution, tried and proved through the ages,
and resorted to unerringly as a matter of course.&nbsp; Thus a
common need is felt, and met instantaneously by a common,
recognised expedient.&nbsp; The judgment of one is necessarily
the judgment of all.&nbsp; Every problem of daily life, however
intricate, is solved by the one device, brought to the fine point
of perfection <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>through the experience of countless generations, and
applied by each individual to the common want, just as hunger
impels all mankind to eat.</p>
<p>Such a condition of affairs, even in a community of human
beings, would imply a very high state of mental, if not of moral,
development in the individual.&nbsp; It would mean entire
negation of self in the interest of the common good.&nbsp; Even
with all the forces of heredity at work, it would need stern
ascetic training for the young, and for the transgressing adult a
swift and merciless retribution, if the last dream of
communism�the abolition of all law and penalty, and the
establishment of a natural autonomy of well-doing�were ever
to be realised in fact.&nbsp; And yet some such state of things
appears to exist in the bee-commonwealth: the individual
worker-bee seems to be the product of some such system carried on
through an indefinite space of time.&nbsp; Order is preserved,
public works go diligently forward, the clock of the national
progress keeps time to the second, not because there is a central
wisdom-force to plan, to govern, to awe recalcitrants, but
because every worker-bee is herself the State in miniature, all
propensities alien to the pure collective spirit having been long
ago bred out of her by the sheer necessities of her case.</p>
<p>The worker-bee, as we see her in the hive to-day, although
evolution must have been busy through the ages determining her
present mind-power and bodily conformation, is nevertheless as <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>much a
product of direct artifice as she is of original nature.&nbsp; We
have seen how the egg containing the feminine germ, if given full
scope and opportunity, develops into what may be taken as the
complete aboriginal type of female bee, differing from the worker
in a dozen essential ways.&nbsp; The queen also is probably, in
one respect at least�her amazing fecundity�a
deliberate creation of the hive-people, as her over-production is
brought about by over-stimulation to meet an artificial state of
affairs.&nbsp; Left to herself, under pristine conditions, she
would certainly lay on a much more moderate scale.&nbsp; But the
worker-bee owes her unique structure and mental constitution
almost entirely to the intervention of her nurses from the moment
of the hatching of the egg.&nbsp; Careful experiment has proved
that the queen-larva and the worker-larva are identical up to the
third day of their life in the cell, except that the queen has
made more rapid growth owing to more generous and more ample
fare.&nbsp; After the third day, the genital system of each larva
will begin to develop, if this rich nitrogenous diet is
maintained.&nbsp; In the case of the queen, this pre-digested
food, well called bee-milk, is lavished on the favoured grub up
to the last moment of its larval existence, no other food being
given.&nbsp; But in the case of the worker-grub, not only has its
supply of bee-milk been restricted in both quantity and quality
from the day of its birth, but now�just before the <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>development
of the ovaries might be expected�an important change is
made.&nbsp; The allowance of bee milk is greatly reduced, while
plain honey is given in addition, but on the same parsimonious
scale, to the end of its five days� larval life.</p>
<p>What other influences, if any, are brought to bear on the
young worker-bee at this portentous stage of her career, it is
impossible to say.&nbsp; But at least the change in the food is
well ascertained, and the results�whether of this alone, or
in combination with other treatment�are more than
astounding.&nbsp; Not only is the development of the sex-organs
so completely arrested that hardly a trace of them can be
discovered in the adult worker-bee, but, from that moment, the
larva seems to become an essentially different creature,
reflecting more and more the attributes of her nurses, and
showing wider and wider departure from those of the
mother-bee.&nbsp; As soon as the worker changes into the pupa
state, organs appear of which the queen has not the faintest
rudiments.&nbsp; She receives her special equipment for
field-work in a pair of baskets for carrying pollen.&nbsp; Her
tongue is lengthened, so that it may reach the nectar hidden deep
down in the clover-bells.&nbsp; She is to become a builder, and
therefore is provided with half a dozen crucibles wherein to
prepare the wax.&nbsp; Her useless ovipositor is changed into a
weapon: it is straightened, shortened; the barbs upon it are
multiplied and strengthened; a gland, <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>with which it is furnished, and
which, in the queen, contains an all but harmless fluid, is now
filled with an active poison.&nbsp; Above all, she develops a
brain-power far in excess of that of the normal female bee, her
mother; and she acquires a whole new set of impulses and
aspirations from beginning to end.</p>
<p>While the queen-bee�s natural element is the obscurity
of the hive, and she would seem both to hate and fear the
sunshine, the worker is essentially an outdoor creature,
revelling in the light and air.&nbsp; While the queen, though
obedient to the destiny that has made her over-fruitful, displays
nevertheless not the slightest joy of motherhood nor interest in
her children, the worker, doomed to eternal spinsterhood, yet
constitutes herself the true mother and nurse and instructress of
all the young in the hive.&nbsp; And the price exacted for the
authority and power which she usurps, or was usurped for her by
those remote ancestors of hers who first invented the sexless
honey-bee, must be paid in the hardest coin�that of life
itself.&nbsp; Instead of the years that nature allotted to her
kind in the beginning, she is to endure hardly as many
months.&nbsp; Destiny, and her own vaulting ambitions, have given
her too arduous a part to play.&nbsp; Her stunted, yet
over-elaborated body and over-developed brain, cannot long hold
out against the wear and tear of the life she is born to.&nbsp;
At best a few months see her dead at her work, or <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>using the
last pulsations of her worn-out, ragged wings to carry her away
to the traditional burial-place of the hive; or her end may be to
fall under the stroke of the State executioners.&nbsp; For the
old-age problem has long ago discovered its effective solution in
the bee-republic.&nbsp; Justice that is capable of being tempered
with mercy carries its own mark of imperfection indelibly upon
it.&nbsp; When the principle of all for the common good has been
driven to its last resort in logic, mercy to the individual can
only be another name for robbing Peter to pay Paul.&nbsp; In
bee-communism the sole title to life is utility, and so the old
worn-out, useless workers must go.</p>
<p>The development of the worker-egg through its various stages
of growth, until the perfectly formed insect emerges from the
cell, makes a curious study.&nbsp; The egg itself is remarkable,
for it is covered with an hexagonal pattern.&nbsp; The large
compound eyes of the fully grown bee also show this form.&nbsp;
Each eye consists of about four thousand separate lenses, and
each lens is a regular hexagon.&nbsp; Wonder has often been
expressed at the ingenuity of the comb-builders in making the
cells six-sided, and thus crowding into a given space more
compartments than could be secured by the same amount of material
wrought into any other shape.&nbsp; The ancient writers explained
this choice of the hexagonal cell by the supposed fact that the
six legs of the bee were simultaneously <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>employed in
comb-building, each leg constructing its own portion of the
cell.&nbsp; A more modern idea is that the particular shape of
the cell is accidental, or rather the outcome of compelling
circumstance, mutual pressure causing the cells to assume the
hexagonal form.</p>
<p>Now, it is quite true that soaked peas in a bottle will take
this shape in swelling, but the analogy will not hold good in
respect of comb-building.&nbsp; In the work of the bees there is
no pressure or constriction of any kind.&nbsp; Each cell is made
separately, being joined on to those above it; and the comb
expands steadily downward and sideways through an empty space
until the desired limit is reached.&nbsp; A much more probable
explanation of the hexagonal form of the cell is that it was
arrived at by experience.&nbsp; The first combs may have been
built with round cells, the interstices being filled in with
wax.&nbsp; But the bee, who is an expert in the science of
economy, would quickly see the disadvantage of this plan.&nbsp;
And with the hexagonal principle, an old familiar thing in the
hive�witness the pattern on the egg-surfaces, and the
compound eye-construction�it would not be long before she
hit upon the better, more scientific way.</p>
<p>There is, however, another reason, and almost as potent a one,
for the adoption of the six-sided cell both for brood-raising and
the storing of honey.&nbsp; It must be remembered that the
present <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>system of vertical walls parallel and close together,
made up of numberless small horizontal chambers placed back to
back, is not an ideal arrangement either for the raising of the
young or the storing of food.&nbsp; Yet it is the best possible
contrivance under the circumstances, which are forced upon the
bee by the necessity of leading a close, crowded, communal
life.&nbsp; Air is a prime need for all operations in the hive,
but for none more than the development of the young bees.&nbsp;
When a queen is to be raised, a full supply of fresh air is given
her, but only at the expense of valuable space.&nbsp; With the
common kind, of which perhaps ten or fifteen thousand may be
maturing in the brood-nest at one and the same time, it is
obviously impossible to make any such concession.&nbsp; The young
worker- or drone-larva must secure what air it can through the
narrow cell-top.&nbsp; Now, the bee breathes at all stages of its
career not through the mouth, but by means of air-holes or
spiracles in the sides of its body.&nbsp; If the cell were round,
the larva, when fairly grown, would fill the space, and the air
would reach the spiracles only with difficulty.&nbsp; But, no
matter what the size of the young grub may be, the angles of the
hexagon cell are never quite filled.&nbsp; They form half a dozen
by-passes for the air, arranged on all sides, and extending right
to the base of the cell; and thus the larva has the full benefit
of the available air-supply, even though it be necessarily
scanty.</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>With
the store-combs the six angles of the cell fulfil an equally
important office.&nbsp; The ideal honey-cell would be one with
its mouth opening upwards, so that it could be filled in an
ordinary rational way.&nbsp; But under the strict economical
principles ruling in the hive such an arrangement would be
impracticable.&nbsp; The honey-vats must be stacked one over the
other in a horizontal position, and therefore must be chargeable
from the end.&nbsp; All cells in the comb have a slight upward
tilt, but not enough to retain the fluid contents if the cell
were a round one.&nbsp; The effect of the angles in the hexagon
is to increase the retentive property of the cell, and experience
has taught the bees how to supplement this natural holding power
of the angles by just that slight cant of the cell which is
necessary to prevent the nectar running out.</p>
<p>The worker-bee, during her period of larval life, at first
lies coiled up at the bottom of the cell, but as her size
increases she takes up a position lengthways, with her head
towards the cell-mouth.&nbsp; This, however, is not a constant
attitude, for she seems at intervals to make a series of slow
gyrations or somersaults, probably to facilitate the casting of
her skin, which she accomplishes several times during her five
days� life as a grub.&nbsp; At the end of this time the
nurse-bees stop the feeding process and seal up the cell.&nbsp;
Now the larva sets to work, first to spin herself a silken shroud
before entering on her long sleep as a chrysalis, and then <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>to change
her skin for the last time.&nbsp; In the case of the worker these
fine-wrought sleeping-clothes envelop her whole body, forming a
continuous cocoon.&nbsp; But the queen-larva weaves herself only
a scanty sort of cloak, covering her head and thorax, but leaving
her nether portions bare.&nbsp; The theory usually advanced in
explanation of this is, that when the surplus queens are
slaughtered in their cells by the accepted mother-bee after her
fertilisation, the fell work is rendered easier by the absence of
the tough material of the cocoon over the parts generally
attacked.&nbsp; It seems to be well substantiated that in a
battle of queens the stings are not used haphazard, as with the
workers, but each queen tries to thrust her weapon into one of
her enemy�s spiracles or breathing-holes, of which she
possesses fourteen, seven on each side.&nbsp; And a stroke dealt
in this way appears to be always fatal.</p>
<p>But, in all likelihood, the true reason why the queen sleeps
in a short gown made of tough, coarse fibre must be looked for
somewhere back in the old ancestral history of the
honey-bee.&nbsp; It is probably safe to consider the complete
worker cocoon as a comparatively recent introduction, evolved to
meet some necessity arising since the bee-people became a
civilised race.&nbsp; But what its true origin was appears to be
out of the reach of all conjecture.&nbsp; A curious fact is that
these cocoons are never removed from the cell.&nbsp; They remain
<a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>fixed to
its sides throughout, and though the cell is otherwise carefully
cleaned after the young bee has vacated it, the cocoon is never
interfered with, but continues as a permanent lining to the
cell.&nbsp; The same thing occurs with all successive
generations, each bee leaving her swaddling-clothes behind her,
until so great an accumulation occurs that the cell becomes too
small for breeding any but a puny, undersized race.&nbsp; With
wild bees, where the nest has been constructed in a tree-hollow,
and there is usually plenty of surplus room, the old brood-combs
may be eventually abandoned and fresh ones built farther
on.&nbsp; Thus the stock generally shifts its station from year
to year.&nbsp; These natural bee-nests, or bee-bikes, as country
people call them, often reach a great age.&nbsp; Sometimes a
swarm will get under the rafters in a house-roof, and may be left
undisturbed for generations.&nbsp; In one case bees were
traditionally supposed to have inhabited a blind loft in a
farmhouse continuously for forty or fifty years.&nbsp; A legend
rife in the village credited them with having stored many tons of
honey, but when the stock was sulphured little more than a vast
accumulation of comb was discovered.&nbsp; This comb was of all
ages, from a few weeks old to an unconjecturable number of
years.&nbsp; Much of it was perfectly black, and the cells choked
up with pupa cocoons.</p>
<p>The fact that egg-laying is continued in these <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>combs where
others are not available, even though the capacity of the cells
has been greatly reduced, seems to cast an added doubt on the
theory that the size of the cell is responsible for the
fertilisation or non-fertilisation of the egg as it is deposited
by the queen.&nbsp; Very old drone-comb is sometimes found in use
for breeding purposes where the cells have become no larger than
those used for normal worker-brood.&nbsp; And yet the queen
continues to lay in them unimpregnated eggs.&nbsp; The whole
question is still hedged round with difficulties.</p>
<p>The young worker-bee, at the end of about three weeks from its
first inception, breaks from its chrysalis-skin, and begins to
gnaw its way through the cell-cover.&nbsp; The pollen, which is
combined with the wax to form this capping, discharges a double
office.&nbsp; It makes the wax porous for the admittance of air,
and it renders the cell-cover edible, thus causing the young bee
to effect its own release through the promptings of its
appetite.&nbsp; The new-born worker, although fully grown, is a
weak, greyish-hued, flaccid creature for some time after it
leaves its cradle.&nbsp; Its earliest impulse seems to be to
groom itself, and then to wander about on a tour of inspection of
its as yet narrow world of gloom and noise and bustle.&nbsp; For
the first day or two it does little else than crawl about
unnoticed in the busy throng, gradually gaining strength and
rigidity of limb.</p>

<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>On
the second day it may be seen dipping into the open honey-vats
and pollen-bins, of which a few are always scattered here and
there among the brood-cells.&nbsp; After this it seems to waken
in earnest to its duties and responsibilities, and takes its
place among the nurse-bees, setting to work with the rest in the
stupendous task of feeding the larv�.</p>
<p>In the ordinary course, the young worker-bee will not leave
the hive for about a fortnight after its emergence from the
cell.&nbsp; In the interval, however, it has a whole policy of
life to study, and several trades to learn.&nbsp; All the indoor
work of the hive appears to be done by the young bees during
these first weeks of their existence.&nbsp; On them the whole
care and sustenance of the young brood depend.&nbsp; They produce
the wax, and build the combs; they look after the order and
cleanliness of the hive; they are the brewers of the honey, and
the keepers of the stores; they feed the queen-bee on her
ceaseless rounds, and also give the drones their daily rations of
bee-milk, for it is certain that the male bees depend very
largely on the workers in this way, drawing only a part of their
diet from the common stores.&nbsp; The old bees are the foragers;
but it is probable they are met by the younger ones soon after
their return to the hive, and their burden of nectar, being
regurgitated, is transferred to the pouches of the young bees, by
whom it is carried to the store-combs in the upper regions of the
hive.&nbsp; At least, if the <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>storage-chamber of a hive be opened
during the busy part of the day, hardly any old bees will be seen
among the crowd, which is industriously filling the cells with
the new-gathered sweets.</p>
<p>It is not until the beginning of the second week of their life
that the young bees make their first essay in the open air, and
then it is only for a few minutes during the hottest part of the
day.&nbsp; This sudden midday uproar is a familiar experience to
the bee-keeper during the late spring and summer; and although
the drones at first contribute largely to the chorus, they soon
fly away, while the singing cloud of bees which remains
enveloping every hive at this time, is entirely composed of the
young house-bees taking their daily brief allowance of exercise
and air.</p>
<p>It is found that the glands necessary for the production of
the brood-food, as also the wax-generating organs, are largely
developed in bees only a few weeks old, while, after their first
month of life is over, these organs are greatly reduced.&nbsp;
The bee generally begins outdoor work as a forager soon after she
has reached the age of fourteen days.&nbsp; It is, however,
probably a week or two longer before she attempts the more
serious business of nectar-gathering.&nbsp; Nearly all the
pollen-bearers are bees in their first young strength and vigour,
and therefore peculiarly adapted to the carrying of heavy
burdens.&nbsp; But as soon as the worker-bee has settled down to
the great <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>paramount task of honey-getting, she seems to leave the
pollen alone.&nbsp; Thus, in a normal colony, the life of the
honey-bee, short as it is, is carefully planned out from
beginning to end, each period having its special task for which
the age of the bee is peculiarly fitted.&nbsp; Yet this rule is
no more absolute than any other of the ways of the hive.&nbsp;
Where the community is short-handed, and there are not enough
mature workers to gather stores, the young bees will be turned
out to forage at a much earlier date in their career.&nbsp; In
the same way, if a hive has been without a queen for some time,
and therefore few young bees are available to care for the brood
when the new mother-bee has at last established herself, many of
the old workers will stay at home and busy themselves with the
nursery-work, which in the ordinary course they would have long
since relinquished.</p>
<p>There are many such instances of ingenious makeshift, or
special adaptation, in the ways of the honey-bee.&nbsp; She is a
creature full of resource on emergencies, but it is in the
provision of desperate remedies for really desperate ills that
she shines at her brightest.&nbsp; The prime disaster in bee-life
is the loss of a queen at a time when it is impossible to appoint
a successor.&nbsp; The standard of intelligence, as well as that
of character, varies among bees almost as much as it does among
men.&nbsp; Some colonies will work harder and for longer hours
than the rest.&nbsp; Others will ease off <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>when they
have put by what they consider a sufficiency of stores, and an
idle spirit spreads visibly among them.&nbsp; In a few cases
there is a distinct moral twist in the national character, and
the bees take to robbing their neighbours� larders instead
of working to furnish their own.</p>
<p>Permanent queenlessness is a calamity which affects different
colonies in different ways.&nbsp; With some it means complete
despair, a cessation of all enterprise or interest in life.&nbsp;
Work is stopped; the guards are withdrawn from the gate; the
community seems to give up in a body, and to await extinction
with no more hope than a batch of criminals in the condemned
cell.&nbsp; But with others the common disaster is but a signal
for a universal quickening of wits, a furbishing-up of all
possible and impossible resources.&nbsp; To bees of this temper
we should look for such episodes as the egg-purloining to supply
a queen-cell, which has been already dealt with.&nbsp; But for
supreme ingenuity, even though it be the forlornest of forlorn
hopes, perhaps there is nothing to equal a device sometimes
resorted to in this last emergency.</p>
<p>Looking through a hive which is not only without a queen, but
which is without any means of raising one, certain mysterious
eggs are unexpectedly discovered.&nbsp; These eggs are obviously
quite newly laid, but not in the orthodox way.&nbsp; A normal
queen works consistently from cell to cell, over a fairly regular
patch of comb, and <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>deposits only one egg in each cell; but these eggs in
the queenless hive have been laid in a curiously haphazard
way.&nbsp; The eggs are straggled over the comb.&nbsp; Two or
three cells have been furnished at one spot and a few more at
another, without the slightest attempt at the usual order and
system.&nbsp; Moreover, some cells contain single eggs, but
others two, or even three, apiece.&nbsp; It looks as if some
demented mother-bee from another hive had caught her keepers
napping, and had made surreptitious excursion into the queenless
stock.&nbsp; But the most careful search through the hive will
reveal no queen, nor is one to be found.&nbsp; The explanation of
the vagary is that one of the workers has, in some extraordinary
way, succeeded in rousing her atrophied nature, and has become
capable of laying eggs.&nbsp; Yet the doom of the colony is not
delayed by this, but rather hastened; for these eggs will produce
only drones, and thus still more useless mouths to feed.&nbsp; In
one well-authenticated case, the bees of a queenless colony built
a queen-cell, and actually transplanted to it one of these eggs
laid by a fertile worker, a dead drone being afterwards found in
the cell.</p>
<p>How the laying worker is produced under the spur of the
national crisis can only be a matter for speculation, but
probably the youngest bee of the colony is plied with the special
food usually given to queens, and thus her generative faculties
are, to a certain extent, developed.</p>

146</span>CHAPTER X<br>
<span class="GutSmall">A ROMANCE OF ANATOMY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> modern commercial
bee-keeper�the man who keeps his bees in hives of the most
approved construction, all alike in colour and shape, and all in
straight rows�is too prone to look only on the practical
side of his work, and to regard with a certain ill-concealed
contempt anything that does not directly promote what is, in his
view, the one and only object of apiculture, that of
honey-getting.</p>
<p>But with the bee-keeper who is also a bee-lover, the tendency
is all the other way.&nbsp; To live in the very spirit of wonder,
as he must who has once dipped down below the surface of
hive-life, is to saddle but a slow, ambling jade for the race in
material prosperity.&nbsp; In a bee-garden the habit of
rumination comes on one like creeping paralysis, gradually but
irresistibly.&nbsp; It is one thing, on a fine June morning, to
start away from the house, pipe in mouth and busily trundling the
honey-barrow, intent on a long day�s work among the hives;
it is quite another thing to keep <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>industriously to the task hour after
hour, when the sun has fixed his slothful golden grip upon you,
and the drowsy song of the bees has worked its will on heart and
mind.</p>
<p>Good resolutions have a way of petering out, reasonably
enough, under these inviting circumstances.&nbsp; The
honey-barrow makes the most comfortable seat in the world, and
can be pulled up just where the shade of the linden-trees is
thickest.&nbsp; Moreover, the blue smoke of tobacco, drifting
lazily up through the sunshine, adds just that touch of
deliberation needed in a scene where all is unmitigated, almost
desperate toil; while what difference can it make if one alone be
idle in the hundred thousand?&nbsp; And so, as often as not, the
creaking wheel comes permanently to rest under the lindens; the
honey is left to the honey-makers; the thoughts follow the bees
into their hives, or may-be wend away over seas to the great
plantations, where the dry weed filling the pipe-bowl was once a
green leaf in an ocean of green, flecked over with blossom, and
sung over by bees, whose ancestors might have come from this very
nook in old England, where it is now all ending in smoke and
quiet thought.</p>
<p>But, especially on rainy days, when there is much to do
indoors�preparing the section-racks, discharging the honey
from the full combs that, empty, they may be returned to the
hives for refilling on the morrow, and what not�the
tendency <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>to set aside obvious, humdrum duties in beemanship has
a still more capable ally.</p>
<p>The beeman with a microscope has given the seven-leagued boots
to his conscience; he will never catch up with it again in a
whole life�s march.&nbsp; If the daily work in the hive, as
seen with the naked eye, is a fascinating, duty-dispersing study,
a microscopic acquaintance with the hive-worker herself, and the
details of her extraordinary equipment, lets one into a whole new
world of fact and thought.</p>
<p>It is only under a strong glass that the true place of the
honey-bee in the scale of creation can be entirely
estimated.&nbsp; Her work is evident to the most casual eye, but
of the worker herself we get only a vague idea of a dim-hued,
crystal-winged atom running a perpetual race with the wind and
sunshine, or forming an all but undistinguishable speck in the
seething, heaving multitudes within the hive.</p>
<p>But here, on the stage of the microscope, the honey-bee is
revealed as a totally new creature; and, by little and little, a
story unfolds itself about her which, in its way, is a perfect
epic of life.&nbsp; No one can study the perplexities of
hive-life for long without a conviction that a creature executing
such varied and elaborate works must, of necessity, be herself
highly developed in body and mind.&nbsp; But it seldom happens,
even with the veriest tiro, that the expectation comes anywhere
near the <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>reality in such an examination of the common
worker-bee.&nbsp; The unaided eye sees a creature, fashioned
simply enough to all appearances�a brown, attenuated body,
two pairs of wings, the usual six legs common to all insects, and
a couple of bent horns, like threshels, that continuously waver
to and fro.&nbsp; But under the glass this simplicity at once
vanishes.&nbsp; From the tip of her antenn� to the barbed
end of her sting, there is nothing about the honey-bee that is
not made on the most bewilderingly, complicated plan.</p>
<p>Watching a hive at work on a busy day in summer, the attention
is first drawn to the pollen-gatherers, labouring in by the
thousand with the big, oval, brightly-coloured masses fixed to
their hindmost legs; and it is first to the pollen-carrying
organism that the glass is now naturally directed.&nbsp; The six
legs, which looked all very much alike to the naked eye, are seen
to be in three pairs, and the construction of each pair differs
very markedly from that of its fellows.&nbsp; So far from their
being simple legs, each has no fewer than nine jointed parts, and
nearly every part carries a special piece of mechanism necessary
and vital in the daily work of the bee.&nbsp; Whole treatises
might be written on the functions of the human hand, yet the hand
is a very simple contrivance compared with the legs of the
honey-bee.&nbsp; The pollen-carrying device is on the thigh of
the hind leg.&nbsp; The thigh is broadened out and hollowed, and
<a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>round
this oblong cavity is a fringe of incurving bristles which look
as if they would hold anything.&nbsp; But before the pollen can
be packed in these baskets it must be collected and kneaded
together.&nbsp; Practically the whole body of the bee is used in
pollen-gathering.&nbsp; Under the low power of the microscope it
is seen that hardly any part of the trunk or limb is without its
dense covering of hairs; but with the high objective these hairs
cease to be hairs, and are changed into actual feathers, delicate
herring-bone implements, which sweep up the pollen as the bee
dives into the flower-cup for the nectar that lies below.</p>
<p>Nearly every joint of each leg is furnished with a comb of
bristles, with which this pollen-dust is scraped off and
transferred to the carrying-basket after being moistened by the
tongue; while the hind-legs have each a complete,
perfectly-fashioned curry-comb.&nbsp; Here the leg is widened and
flattened, and covered on one side with nine or ten rows of
short, strong spines, with which the bee scrapes her body just as
a groom curry-combs a horse.&nbsp; At ordinary times she will
carefully pack her load of pollen into its proper receptacles
before returning to the hive, so that it shall be all ready for
transference to the cells.&nbsp; At the cell-mouth she pushes
each lump off by means of her other legs, leaving it to be rammed
down into the cell by the store-keepers.&nbsp; No distinction is
made here, every kind and colour of pollen being <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>indiscriminately stored in the same cell; and when the
cell is full, a thin layer of honey is smeared over all, to
preserve it from the air.&nbsp; When, however, time presses, the
bee will not stop to knead up the load, but will carry it home as
it is, arriving in the hive smothered completely from head to
foot as with gold-dust.&nbsp; Then the house-bees gather round
her, soon scraping her free of her encumbrance, and she starts
off again for another load.</p>
<p>The fact that insects can walk on both upper and under
surfaces apparently with equal ease, is none the less remarkable
because we see it going on every day of our lives.&nbsp; Yet the
fly, crawling up the window-glass, or running about on the
ceiling, owes his power of topsy-turvy perambulation to a very
ingenious device.&nbsp; This is well illustrated in the foot of a
bee.&nbsp; She has a pair of short, strong double claws, which
will take her securely over all but the smoothest and shiniest
surfaces; and it is with these claws that bees form themselves
into dense clusters and knots and cables within the hive, holding
hand-to-hand, as it were, in all directions.&nbsp; But when there
is nothing for the claw to hold by, another part of the foot
comes into play.&nbsp; This is a soft, flexible pad, which is
always covered by a thick, oily exudation.&nbsp; In walking, the
bee puts her feet down three at a time, the pads adhering
instantly they come into contact with the smooth surface.&nbsp;
At the next step the other three pads come into play, while the
first three are <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>stripped off.&nbsp; But each foot is capable of
attaching and detaching itself independently of its
fellows.&nbsp; In this case the stripping is accomplished by
downward pressure of the claws of the same foot.</p>
<p>On each of her fore-legs the bee has an appliance which
fulfils a very important office.&nbsp; It is a semicircular notch
with a fringe of strong hairs, and when the leg is bent up, this
notch engages with a curious projection on the next upper joint,
forming an eyelet roughly circular in shape.&nbsp; With this
exact and special tool she cleans her antenn�, and this is
done at short intervals throughout the whole active time of her
life, much as, in the operation of winking, the human eye is kept
cleansed.&nbsp; The tongue also is freed from adhering grains of
pollen by this device.</p>
<p>The question, How does a bee gather the flower-juices to make
her honey? is met by certain popular naturalists with the
assurance that she sucks them through a tube.&nbsp; This is so
easy a generalisation that it amounts very nearly to positive
error.&nbsp; The tongue of the bee is not a tube, as the word is
usually understood.&nbsp; And she laps up the nectar as often as
she sucks it.&nbsp; It depends entirely on the quantity to be
dealt with; and a little careful dissection of the mouth-parts of
the bee, by means of the microscope and a pair of long needles,
will soon make the whole matter clear.</p>
<p>She is no beauty�the honey-bee, seen at such close
quarters; unending toil, and a perverted, <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>baffled
nature, do not tend to loveliness in any of her sex.&nbsp; But
her positive and almost terrifying ugliness, when looked at so
disadvantageously, is soon forgotten as one comes to realise her
abounding possession of that other kind of beauty�the
beauty of utility.</p>
<p>To the naked eye her tongue is a bright brown, shining piece,
protruding from her mouth, and hanging down with much the same
appearance as an elephant�s trunk.&nbsp; Under the
microscope it is soon seen that this is not a tongue in the
proper sense, but a continuation of the under-lip.&nbsp; It
consists of six or seven different parts capable of being fitted
together lengthways.&nbsp; There is a central part, longer than
the rest, with a hairy spatula at its end, and when the other
parts are closed about this, the whole virtually forms a tube
within a tube.&nbsp; The spatula does the lapping when only
minute quantities of fluid have to be taken up, and these pass
into the mouth more by capillary attraction than by actual
sucking; but when there is a brimming cup of nectar to be
emptied, the whole mechanism of the tongue is brought into
play.&nbsp; The longitudinal strips are placed together edge to
edge, and the liquid is drawn out of the flower-cup by the action
of the tongue-muscles in much the same way as water is lifted by
a pump.</p>
<p>Now that we have the head of the bee under observation, many
curious things about it can be <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>ascertained.&nbsp; The strong,
curved jaws, working sideways, are doubly interesting as the main
implements used in the preparation of the wax, and largely in the
comb-building.&nbsp; But the eyes and the long, flail-like
antenna rivet attention first.&nbsp; Whether the bee was made for
her life, or the life�imposed on her by inexorable
conditions�made the bee what she is to-day, the
extraordinary adaptation of her physique to her environment is
beyond all question.&nbsp; The great compound eyes, with their
thousands of facets each pointing in a slightly different
direction, are obviously made for wide and distant
outlooks.&nbsp; It is with these eyes that the bee finds her way
out and home over miles of country.&nbsp; In the worker the
compound eyes occupy the whole sides of the head, but in the
drone they are much larger, and meet entirely at the top.&nbsp;
Thus, dallying in the sunshine, he is able the while to keep the
whole arc of the sky under scrutiny, ready at an instant�s
notice to take up the love-challenge of the young queens.</p>
<p>But these large multiple eyes of the bee are of little use to
her at close quarters, or in the deep twilight of the hive.&nbsp;
For indoor use, and for near vision, she has three other eyes,
containing a single lens each, and set in her forehead just above
her antenn�.&nbsp; The popular belief, that the honey-bee
carries on her busy life, and elaborate enterprises in complete
darkness, is mainly a <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>fallacy.&nbsp; Probably there is
always some light, even in the remotest recesses of the
hive�enough, at least, for the eyes of the bee, if not for
our own vision.</p>
<p>The bee, however, would seem to depend very little on sight
alone in the prosecution of her various tasks.&nbsp; There is
little doubt that she possesses all the other four senses in a
marked degree.&nbsp; Both the tongue and the lips have certain
highly developed structures upon them which can be nothing else
than organs of taste; while the most superficial acquaintance
with the life of the hive must convince anyone that the bee
possesses the senses of smell and hearing, and that very
acutely.&nbsp; Where the seat of these two faculties lies is at
present doubtful, and the exact functions of the antenn�
are still a matter of conjecture.&nbsp; But it is at least
certain that these latter perform vital office in every act or
enterprise of the bee.&nbsp; It is obvious that the antenn�
are very delicate organs of touch, but it is equally obvious that
they are much more than this.&nbsp; It has been ascertained that
they carry no less than six totally different kinds of
instruments, each of which must have its distinct use.</p>
<p>Observation of the ways of the honey-bee has been carried on
for thousands of years.&nbsp; More books have been written about
the bee than perhaps of all other creatures put together.&nbsp;
And yet our knowledge of her powers and organisation must still
<a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>be
reckoned in its infancy.&nbsp; The microscopists have dissected
her antenna and isolated all their various parts, but of the
particular functions of these little or nothing is known at
present.&nbsp; There are certain hairs, evenly distributed over
the whole surface, which are presumably instruments of
touch.&nbsp; But there are other hairs, or fine cones, which are
hollow, enclosing a delicate nerve-fibre; hairs set loosely in a
cavity; hairs curved and ringed, and of different lengths.&nbsp;
Then there are mysterious pits and depressions, either open or
covered with incredibly thin membranes, enshrining nerve-ends
only just visible with the highest objectives.&nbsp; And the
whole is linked up in an intricate nervous system that baffles
every art and patience of research; while, when all has been
investigated and described, no one is really any the wiser.</p>
<p>The antenna are certainly touch-organs, and, in all
likelihood, it is by their means that the bee hears and
smells.&nbsp; Yet this only exhausts a few of their manifest
possibilities.&nbsp; It is quite clear that we must admit the
honey-bee to possess other senses than the five we know of;
and�for a guess�some of these mysterious implements
on her antenna may be thought-transmitters and -receivers on the
wireless plan.&nbsp; The wonderful unanimity of action among bees
may be due to the fact that they can exchange ideas through the
air, as men have now at last come to do.&nbsp; The <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>faculty of
speech, hitherto held up as man�s insignia of lordship over
the rest of creation, may be indeed a crude, archaic thing,
compared with the mind-language of the honey-bees.</p>
<p>There is another conceivable function which the antenn�
of bees may perform�that of unerring and instant estimation
of short distances.&nbsp; They may be delicate measuring
instruments, not mechanically applied in the way of a foot-rule
or metric scale, but registering dimensions inherently, as our
ears record intensity of sound.&nbsp; This would go far to
explain how honeycomb is built, how the cells are made all of the
same shape and size, although hundreds of the mason-bees are at
work on the structure, not only at the same moment, but in
succession, each bee coming and going in the murmurous gloom of
the hive, and beginning instantly and unhesitatingly at the point
where her predecessor broke off.&nbsp; As the central division of
the comb grew, expanding in all directions downward, and the
cells were built out horizontally at the same time, the bee would
know by her sense of dimension when the limit of each side in the
hexagonal cell-base was reached, and would know the proper angle
to turn off at in the laying of the next foundation-line.</p>
<p>Anyone who has watched the flight of the bee must have been
struck by its sheer facility and freedom no less than by its
speed.&nbsp; It is quite evident that the bee is not only an
accomplished <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>a�rial navigator, but that she sustains and
propels herself through the air with very little effort.&nbsp;
Obviously her equipment for flight must be a thoroughly efficient
one, and yet at first glance it is not quite clear how she
manages so well.&nbsp; The student of the flight-problem, taking
his ideas and conception of first principles from the flight of
birds, is accustomed to believe that there are at least two vital
indispensable elements in the process�a pair of wings or
combination of a�roplane and propellers that will sustain as
well as drive, and some sort of steering-apparatus like the
bird�s tail.&nbsp; Yet, as far as a first general
inspection carries us, the bee appears to have no
rudder-mechanism at all, but to depend on her four wings for
every purpose.&nbsp; The wings of the bird have a variable
action.&nbsp; They can be used together or separately, and are as
capable of eccentric adjustment, both in themselves and in
relation to one another, as a pair of human arms.&nbsp; But the
bee�s wings have none of this adaptability.&nbsp; They have
but the one motion, up and down; and they work symmetrically,
each wing keeping time with its fellow.&nbsp; Yet the bee steers
herself perfectly well in a hundred different evolutions,
accomplishing all that the bird attains with his more complicated
apparatus for flight.</p>
<p>The whole problem is bound up with another problem; and the
two, difficult of solution apart, easily resolve one another when
taken in <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>conjunction.&nbsp; Insects are so called because their
bodies are in two parts, entirely divided except for an extremely
slender connecting joint.&nbsp; We are so accustomed to accept
this arrangement as a common fact in nature that we seldom stop
to consider its real significance.&nbsp; It is not easy to see
how such a construction can be anything else than a drawback to
any living creature.&nbsp; But in the hive-bee the whole
arrangement seems to amount to what must be called an ideal
inconvenience, seeing that her honey-sac and complicated organs
for producing the larval food are in her abdomen, with no way to
them but through this fine joint.&nbsp; Clearly there is some
weighty reason for it, out-balancing all other considerations, or
it would not exist; and when we come to study it in connection
with the honey-bee�s peculiar system of flight, we soon
arrive at the true solution.</p>
<p>It has been said that the wings of the bee have a perfectly
symmetrical action, and that they have a single fixed direction,
moving up and down, always at right-angles with the line of the
thorax.&nbsp; Under the microscope each of the four wings is seen
as a transparent, impervious membrane, intersected with fine
ribs.&nbsp; The front wing, however, has a much stronger and
stiffer rib running the entire length of its upper edge, and it
is on this main rib that almost the entire force of the
flight-muscles is concentrated.&nbsp; If you look farther, you
will see that the under wing has a row of fine <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>hooks along
its top edge, while the lower edge of the upper wing is flanged
or folded back.&nbsp; In flight the hooks on one wing engage with
the flange on the other, and thus the wings on each side are
automatically locked together, forming one continuous
air-resisting surface.&nbsp; This combined wing is very flexible
throughout, except at its upper edge, where it is stiffened by
the main rib.&nbsp; In action, therefore,�the force being
applied practically to the edge alone, which resists the air
while the rest of the wing bends to it�the result is that
the whole wing becomes an oscillating, inclined plane, whose
inclination, forward on the down-stroke, is still forward on the
up-stroke, because the plane-inclination reverses itself
automatically.</p>
<p>From this it will be understood how the flexible wings of the
bee are used in straightforward flight; but, seeing that the
wings themselves are incapable of independent or irregular
action, it is not yet clear how the bee contrives to steer
herself, rising or descending, or turning sideways, just as the
mood seizes her.&nbsp; It is here that the reason for the
peculiar construction of her body becomes plain.&nbsp; The fine
link which unites her abdomen to her thorax is really an
universal joint, actuated by a series of powerful cross-muscles,
and the bee steers herself through the air by using the weight of
the lower half of her body as a counterpoise.&nbsp; By swinging
her heavy abdomen forward or <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>backward, or from side to side, she
changes her centre of gravity, and the line of force of her
a�roplanes, at one and the same time.&nbsp; Actually her
body keeps its vertical position, being her heaviest part, and it
is the lighter wing-supporting thorax which is deflected.&nbsp;
But the result is the same, and every variety and direction of
flight is accomplished by the bee on what seems a far more simple
plan than that evidenced in the flight of birds.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things to account for in the life of
the honey-bee is the fact that the temperature of the hive can be
varied at the will of its occupants.&nbsp; The system of
mechanical ventilation will, of course, explain how the hive is
kept cool in the greatest heats of summer, but it does not
explain the sudden accessions of heat to which it is liable from
time to time.&nbsp; These occur principally when the wax is being
generated.&nbsp; Under the bronze armour-plates of her body the
worker-bee has six shallow, but broad depressions, beneath which
the wax-glands are placed.&nbsp; Perfect rest and a high
temperature seem to be necessary for the stimulation of these
glands, and the wax-makers consume a large quantity of sweet-food
during the process.&nbsp; It is generally stated that bees fill
themselves from the stores of mature honey before uniting in the
cluster; but it is more probable that the food consumed during
wax-making is principally the nectar, almost as gathered from the
flowers.&nbsp; This view is confirmed by <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>certain
experiments which were undertaken to decide the amount of food
assimilated during the production of a given weight of wax.&nbsp;
When the bees had access only to honey, it was found that five or
six pounds were needed during the time that one pound of wax was
produced.&nbsp; But if the bees were fed on a plain syrup of
cane-sugar, more wax was generated.&nbsp; The chemical
composition of fresh nectar is almost identical with that of
sugar from the sugar-cane, but mature honey contains practically
no cane-sugar at all.&nbsp; It is very doubtful, therefore, if
the economic bee would deplete her hard-won stores of honey for a
purpose that could be better accomplished in another and cheaper
way.&nbsp; And it should also be borne in mind that the natural
time for comb-building coincides with the season when nectar is
in greatest plenty.</p>
<p>These sudden variations in temperature appear to be brought
about by a wholesale increase in the rate of respiration among
the bees; and there is nothing that excites the wonder of the
student of hive-life more than the breathing-apparatus of the
bee, as seen under the microscope.&nbsp; Practically her whole
physical system is directly supplied with air, drawn in through
her many spiracles.&nbsp; As far as scientists have been able to
determine, there is not a fibre or nerve in her entire body that
is not reached by the minute ramifications of the air-ducts, in
direct communication with the great main breathing-vessels in the
bee�s abdomen.&nbsp; <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Respiration appears to be largely
voluntary with the honey-bee.&nbsp; She breathes only when the
necessity for it arises, and will sometimes arrest the action
entirely for three or four minutes together.&nbsp; But when the
wax-making is going forward, or swarming-time is near at hand,
the quick, vibratory movement of respiration is visible
everywhere in the throng of bees, and the temperature of the hive
climbs up often to a dozen degrees above its normal point.</p>
<p>The breathing system of the honey-bee is closely connected
with her sound-organs.&nbsp; Anyone asked to describe the note
made by a bee would probably say that she hums or buzzes, and
there would be an end to most ideas on the matter.&nbsp; But to
the beeman this is a pitifully inadequate statement of the
truth.&nbsp; The bee comprises in herself not one, but a whole
choir of voices, and she has a compass of at least an octave and
a half.&nbsp; Every one of her fourteen spiracles, and each of
her wings, is capable of producing sound; and these sounds can be
endlessly varied in quality, intensity, and pitch.&nbsp; It is no
exaggeration to say that the honey-bee is as accomplished a
musician as any bird; but as each individual voice is for the
most part lost in the general symphony of the hive, it is
difficult to get a complete idea of her capabilities as a
soloist.</p>
<p>The voice-apparatus in the spiracles is one of the most
intricate things in the whole anatomy of <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>the
bee.&nbsp; It has a multiplicity of parts, and is obviously
designed to convey a great variety of sounds.&nbsp; The wings
also produce tones that run up or down in the scale, according to
their rate of oscillation; and from them comes the sibilant note
usually called buzzing.&nbsp; Listening to the hive-music at any
season of the year, it is impossible to resist the thought that
bees not only hold individual communication by means of these
infinitely varied sounds, but that the general note given out by
the multitude unerringly expresses the state of affairs within
the hive for the time being.&nbsp; A prosperous stock voices its
busy contentment in a way impossible to misunderstand.&nbsp; It
is a deep, blithe, resonant sound, like the steady running of
well-oiled machinery, each wheel adding its own whirring melody
to the general theme.&nbsp; Weak or famishing colonies give out a
wavering, intermittent note, the very voice of complaint and fear
for the future.&nbsp; When a hive has lost its queen, a capable
bee-master should have no difficulty in divining the trouble by
listening at the hive-entrance.&nbsp; A queenless stock is all
clamour and the hubbub of divided counsels.&nbsp; The ordinary
rich reverberation of labour stops, and a sound of panic goes to
and fro in the hive unceasingly.&nbsp; If a hive be quietly
opened, and its queen removed with little disturbance, it may be
some time before the bees discover their loss.&nbsp; Some
colonies experimented with in this way realise their deprivation
<a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>immediately, and the hue-and-cry begins at once.&nbsp;
But one of the most curious facts in bee-life is the variation in
intelligence, and alertness of perception, between the different
hives.&nbsp; A steady-going, dull race may be a considerable time
before it perceives the absence of its queen.&nbsp; The common
note of work goes on unchanged until the fact dawns on it.&nbsp;
And then the peculiar shrill outcry commences, overpowering all
other sounds until reason again asserts itself in the colony, and
the bees set about the work of raising another queen.</p>
<p>The voice of the drone is deeper and hoarser than that of the
worker-bee, by reason of his larger body; and his noisier buzzing
is explained by his greater length and breadth of wing.&nbsp; The
queen also has a deeper, more husky voice during flight; but she
has, in addition, a peculiar cry of her own, an old familiar
sound to bee-keepers all the world over.&nbsp; It is heard
principally just before the swarming of the hive.&nbsp; Certain
old skeppists profess to be able to foretell the date on which a
swarm will issue by studying the cry of the queen.&nbsp; On quiet
nights, just before the swarming-season commences, it may
frequently be heard above the general murmur of the hive by
bending the ear down to the entrance.&nbsp; It is a shrill piping
sound, repeated over and over again, and often answered by other
and fainter notes.&nbsp; How it is produced is not certainly
known, but probably it is caused <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>by the wings or legs being sharply
rubbed together, much as a cricket or grasshopper utters its
cry.&nbsp; The louder note is made by the old queen, and there is
no doubt of its import.&nbsp; Jealousy and the lust of battle are
on her, and she is trying to get at the young princesses in their
cells.&nbsp; The cry is one of baffled fury as she strives with
the guards about the cells, and the answering notes come from the
imprisoned queens who are just as eager for the fray.&nbsp; The
old skeppists are never far out in their reckoning.&nbsp; When
this state of affairs has begun, the crisis is imminent; and the
morrow is sure to see the emigrating party setting off for its
new home, carrying the old queen irresistibly with it.</p>
<p>It has been said that the nurse-bees, who have the entire
charge and care of the young brood, feed the larv� from
their mouths with a thick white fluid, which is aptly called
bee-milk.&nbsp; All the time the nurses are engaged on this work,
they are themselves hearty eaters of both honey and pollen; so
that at first sight it appears as if the bee had the power of
instantaneous digestion, feeding herself at one moment, and, at
the next, regurgitating this food, changed into a totally
different substance, to feed the young grubs.&nbsp; Moreover,
there is another wonderful thing regarding this bee-milk.&nbsp;
It has been proved by careful analysis that its composition
varies considerably.&nbsp; The male, female, and
queen-larv� are all fed with it, but its constitution
differs, not only with each kind of larva, but according to the
age the larva has reached.&nbsp; The bee must therefore have her
whole system of digestion under full voluntary control.&nbsp; How
she manages this critical part of her work can only be understood
by the aid of a good microscope.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>Perhaps there is nothing more wonderful, in the whole
wonderful anatomy of the bee, than her digestive organism and its
contributory system of glands, each of which has its special and
important use.&nbsp; When she draws up the nectar from the
flowers, it passes at once into the first of her two stomachs,
which is simply and solely a reservoir.&nbsp; Here it can remain
indefinitely at the will of the bee; or it can be thrown up and
poured into the comb-cells, to be brewed into honey; or it can be
allowed to pass through a valve at the base of the reservoir into
the bee�s second and lower stomach, where digestion takes
place and the honey and pollen are formed into chyle.&nbsp; But,
by one of the most ingenious devices in nature, this second
stomach is also capable of returning its contents to the mouth,
and the chyle is there changed into bee-milk for the nourishment
of the larv�.</p>
<p>The worker-bee has, in all, four distinct glands, each
secreting a fluid with properties different from the other
three.&nbsp; These glands are all situated in the mouth.&nbsp;
Two of them have a common opening in the upper side of the root
of the tongue; and as the bee sucks, their combined secretions
mingle <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>with the flower juices automatically, and the first
step in the change of the nectar into honey takes place.&nbsp;
The third gland is in the roof of the mouth, and it is the
secretion from this gland which acts on the regurgitated chyle,
and changes it into brood-food.&nbsp; The fourth gland is
double.&nbsp; These twin-glands have their openings at the base
of the jaws, and the action of chewing is necessary to excite
their secretion.</p>
<p>The valve between the upper, or honey-stomach, and the lower,
or chyle-stomach, has an extensible neck, and the bee can, at
will, raise this telescopic piece through the interior of the
honey-sac until the valve is pressed against the opening into the
gullet.&nbsp; Thus the contents of the lower stomach can be
driven into the mouth without coming into contact with the stored
sweets in the reservoir, and this pre-digested matter is always
ready at an instant�s notice for the use of the larva, or
for the nourishment of drones or queen.</p>
<p>It has been said that the nursery-work of the hive is
undertaken exclusively by the young bees during the first
fortnight or so of their lives.&nbsp; After this time they make
their first foraging expedition, beginning with pollen-gathering,
and relinquishing this in turn for the collection of nectar when
they have arrived at full maturity.&nbsp; The mature workers take
no part in the feeding of the larv�, except on very rare
emergencies.&nbsp; In relation to this, it is a curious fact that
the gland in the roof of the mouth, <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>which acts on the chyle, forming it
into brood-food, is in full development only during the first
weeks of the worker-bee�s career.&nbsp; After that its
activity swiftly declines, until, in old workers, it becomes
largely atrophied.</p>
<p>The digestive gland-system of the honey-bee, although it has
been fairly well explored by the scientific naturalists, is still
much of a mystery, and this especially with regard to the glands
attached to the jaws.&nbsp; The secretion from these
glands�obviously a very powerful acid�is mainly used
to convert the raw wax from its hard, brittle character into the
soft, ductile material of which the combs are made.&nbsp; It is
probably used to some extent, also, in the preparation of the
brood-food, in conjunction with the gland in the roof of the
mouth.&nbsp; It mingles with the pollen when this is masticated,
and no doubt it has various other uses; but no one seems as yet
to have discovered why these two glands should be so enormously
developed in the queen, who takes no part in the nursery-work or
comb-building.&nbsp; The whole question will naturally have
little more than a passing interest for the general reader; but,
to the bee-keeper with a microscope, it takes a prominent place
among the debatable things in hive-life.&nbsp; If the difference
between the queen-bee and the worker-bee�a difference of
organic structure as well as mere development�is really
brought about by variation in the quality and <a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>quantity of
the food supplied to the larva, then the action of these glands
cannot be over-estimated in importance, and cannot be studied too
deeply: they form the very spring and fount of life.&nbsp; Yet is
it certain that the influence brought to bear on the young grubs
by the nurse-bees is wholly restricted to the matter of
food?&nbsp; The worker-bee has several curious organs and
gland-systems in various parts of her body, in addition to those
already enumerated, to which no rational use has yet been
assigned.&nbsp; The more we study her extraordinary equipment,
the less justification there appears to be for dogmatising about
her, limiting or particularising the function of any one gland or
implement in the whole unending array.&nbsp; The old adage, that
there is nothing invariable about the honey-bee, is like to be as
true with regard to her physiology as it is with her habits of
life; and, for all we can tell, to-morrow�s knowledge may
render obsolete much of the carefully garnered knowledge of
to-day.</p>
<p>If the story of the honey-bee�s anatomy has everywhere
some of the elements of romance about it�in its unexpected
incidents, its adventurous colour, its shadow of a great
design�this spirit suffers no abatement when we come, in a
last view of it, to consider her as one carrying arms, one
bearing such a weapon of offence as never came into human mind to
fashion.&nbsp; The long curved scimitar of the queen, which she
cherishes so <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>carefully that nothing will induce her to strike with
it except when it is to be turned against a royal foe, is
otherwise little else than a harmless piece of domestic
furniture.&nbsp; But the sting of the valorous worker-bee, seen
under a microscope, is a positively terrifying engine of
destruction.&nbsp; Popular science generally describes it as a
sheath containing a barbed and poisonous dart; and the trite
comparison is always made of the bee�s sting with the
finest sewing-needle, the latter being likened to a rough bar of
iron.&nbsp; The idea of a sheath is pure fiction, as a little
painstaking examination will soon reveal.</p>
<p>The bee�s sting is made up of three separate lances,
each with a barbed edge, and each capable of being thrust forward
independently of the others.&nbsp; The central and broader lance
has a hollow face, furnished at each side with a rail, or
beading, which runs its whole length.&nbsp; On the back of each
of the other two lances there is a longitudinal groove, and into
these grooves fit the raised beadings of the central
lancet.&nbsp; Thus the sting is like a sword with three
blades�united, but sliding upon one another�the
barbed points of which continue to advance alternately into the
wound, going ever deeper and deeper of their own malice
aforethought after the initial thrust is made.&nbsp; It is a
device of war, compared to which the explosive bullet is but a
clumsy brutality.&nbsp; Yet this is not all.&nbsp; To make its
death-dealing powers <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>doubly sure, this thorough-minded
amazon must fill the haft of her triple blade with a subtle
poison, and so contrive its sliding mechanism that the same
impulse, which drives the points successively forward, drenches
the whole weapon with a fatal juice.</p>
<p>The tendency to be unduly scientific, to meet these things
with exact and unimaginative interest, receives its final quietus
here.&nbsp; For he who realises the whole deadly efficacy of the
honey-bee�s sting cannot logically pass it by as a mere
remarkable provision of nature, praising God for it complacently,
but must concede it a much wider significance.&nbsp; This
complicated weapon of the stunted, sex-perverted worker-bee owes
its existence as much to deliberate art as to nature, or those
who watch the Omnipotent in hive-life are strangely and
perversely led astray.&nbsp; In the queen-mother, whose physical
organism may be said to be comparatively unchanged from its
aboriginal type, we see the part corresponding to the
worker�s sting, essentially another creation.&nbsp; The
queen�s ovipositor is longer; it is curved; the barbs upon
it are small and insignificant; the fluid in the secreting-gland
is no poison at all, but a thick opaque substance, whose true use
is probably to glue the eggs safely to the bottoms of the
cells.&nbsp; She is also provided with a pair of blunt
instruments covered with sensitive hairs, which serve, with the
ovipositor, to guide the egg securely to <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>its
destination.&nbsp; The worker-bee has these feelers on either
side of her sting, but she has perverted them to a very different
office, that of seeking out the vulnerable parts of her
enemy.&nbsp; And what a drastic change her will, or that of her
foster-mothers, has wrought in the whole contrivance!&nbsp; She
has bartered the privilege of motherhood and years of life for a
few short months and a share in the communal sovereignty.&nbsp;
She must be ready to further the well-being of the hive by the
art of war as well as by the arts of peace.&nbsp; Therefore she
has deliberately helped in fashioning the ploughshares into
cannon.&nbsp; A little change in her food as a nursling, an
infinitesimal leaking from a gland that takes the full power of
the strongest glass to see,�and, with all the other
multitudinous changes of form and character, this last miracle
comes quietly into being.&nbsp; The egg-depositing shaft grows
short and straight; its moderate indentations become cruel jagged
barbs designed to hold as well as to kill; the harmless,
egg-fastening gluten is quickened into a virulent poison; and the
death-dealing thing is ready and ripe for service against all
honey-lovers, the hereditary foes of the hive.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE MYSTERY OF THE SWARM</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old �swarm in May,�
beloved of ancient beemen, is rapidly becoming a thing of the
past.&nbsp; Modern hives and modern methods, although they have
not as yet achieved their main intent of abolishing natural
swarming altogether, yet tend to bring this extraordinary
ebullition of hive-life to its fulfilment later and later in each
year.&nbsp; Far from being a virtue, as of old, an early swarm,
or indeed any swarm at all, is now accounted a misfortune, even a
downright disgrace, in scientific beemanship.&nbsp; And yet the
bees, though easy to discourage, are hard to teach.&nbsp; In
spite of roomy hives and a watchful bee-master ready to give them
an unbroken succession of young and fertile queens, and a whole
houseful of new furniture at a moment�s notice, still the
bees go on playing this mad game of wholesale truantry, and still
the bee-keeper must stand looking hopelessly on from the midst of
his elaborate appliances, while his property sings about his
ears, or wings away into the upper skies, irrevocable as last
year�s mill-water.</p>

<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>Beemen call it the swarming fever; and fever it is in
very truth.&nbsp; The reasons for it have long ago been
crystallised into exact and accepted phrases.&nbsp; An
overcrowded condition of the hive; the desire of the bees to get
rid of a failing queen; the excitement of the queen herself at
the menace of coming rivals; the natural instinct of colonies to
increase and multiply�anything but the one all-sufficient
and obvious reason, that bees swarm because they suddenly and
intensely desire it.</p>
<p>The story of the Sioux Indian,�won for civilisation from
boyhood, over-educated and overrefined, decorated with a high
college-degree and adorning a great pulpit, and then casting it
all to the four winds, stripping and painting himself, and raging
away with his kind on the war-trail,�has a near parallel in
the behaviour of bees at swarming-time.&nbsp; Instinct could
never be a party to such an inconsequent, outrageous, brilliantly
reckless, joyous proceeding.&nbsp; But it is ever in the way of
reason to be splendidly unreasonable at times, and here the
honey-bee shows herself the true child of her origins.&nbsp; From
a stern, self-elected destiny-maker, callously pressing to the
forefront of life over all obstacles of heart and hearth, she
changes back, for the nonce, into the aboriginal bee-woman,
thoughtless, pleasure-loving, <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>improvident, spending the garnered
treasure of laborious days in the one mad moment�s
frolic.</p>
<p>For it is impossible to regard the incident of the swarm as
only one more link in the chain of sober, calculating
bee-wisdom.&nbsp; It is obviously a lapse, a general falling away
from the all-wise, public polity.&nbsp; For a single hour in her
drudging, joyless, perfect life, the worker-bee battens down all
the virtues, and rages forth like the Sioux Indian to swill at
the stream of forbidden love and laughter, unmindful of the
cost.&nbsp; Just when the common self-abnegation is yielding its
rich first-fruits of prosperity, and the hive is overflowing with
its wealth of citizens and possessions, this fever comes among
them, and spreads like a prairie fire.&nbsp; By all laws of
prudence it is now, of all times, that every child of the
Mother-State should stand by her mightily, to uphold her in the
high place won for her by unending toil and innumerable
lives.&nbsp; But old ancestral memory wakens, calling
irresistibly.&nbsp; Nature, in the beginning of time, made the
honey-bee to inhabit a tropic land, where there was no need for
pent, cold-withstanding houses, nor any use in laying up
provender for days of dearth, because the land flowed with
perpetual honey.&nbsp; Bee-life in those far-off ages was all
dancing in the sunshine, and the bee-woman had little to do but
to fly to the nearest brimming flower-cup when her nurslings
wanted food, But a cooling world, the ever <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>northward
trend of her race, and then the folly of her own
wisdom�intellect turning upon itself�all combined to
lose for her the old slothful paradise of plenty.&nbsp; The
drone, reasoning inversely by the wisdom of his folly, made a
better compromise with fate.&nbsp; He held to his life of ease
and his gratuitous pleasures at all cost, and let his mate go her
way undeterred, blinding his eyes to the new necessities.&nbsp;
Work and responsibility gradually soured and sharpened and
hardened the one, while dependence on his womenkind as
insidiously changed the other into a creature of idleness and the
senses.&nbsp; And when he came at last to realise the outcome of
it all, it was too late.&nbsp; The matriarchal commonwealth was
established, hedged round securely with a myriad poisoned
blades.&nbsp; To live a drone had been his heart�s desire,
and now dronehood, mere seminality, was allotted to him as a
retribution.&nbsp; The things for which man lifts his unregarded
prayer all his life through, might very well prove his fittest
punishment, granted to him in the Hereafter: so little can man or
drone distinguish between the enduring things of life and
death.</p>
<p>But of all intolerable fates, that must be least bearable, to
have wisely willed and beautifully fashioned our own eternity;
and then, being only human, or at least reasonable, to find its
goodness really smooth-going, colour-fast, impregnable at all
points, with never a bright break or flaw to <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>vary the
monotony of well-doing.&nbsp; No wonder the honey-bee swarms,
breaks helter-skelter out of her prison-bounds of order,
commendable toil, chill, maidenly propriety; and goes rioting
away for one short hour of joyousness and madcap frolic, such as
her prim�val sisters looked to as the common day�s
lot, when there were no hives, and motherhood was not the sole
prerogative of one in thirty thousand, and when the sun burned
high and cheerily in heaven from end to end of the tropic
year.&nbsp; It is easy to be wise, and temperately scientific, in
accounting for this feverish impulse of the worker-bees,
allotting it a sound and circumspect part in the furtherance of
the general polity.&nbsp; But is it not, in the main,
Nature�the atrophied sexual spirit�awakening, or at
least stirring a little in her age-long sleep?&nbsp; In the
sultry August evenings the young queens of the ant-hills pour out
in unnumbered thousands to meet the males, and people the ruddy
sunshine with the glint of their wings.&nbsp; This is swarming in
its truest sense.&nbsp; The wingless, workful, underground
existence follows, but the love-flight of the ants, while it
lasts, is none the less a real, intensely joyous thing.&nbsp; And
surely the swarming-fever that so strangely and inopportunely
seizes upon hive-life, is at one with it in nature and spirit,
although its original purpose and value have been long ago lost
in the ages.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>The
one in the whole multitude who alone has the full inheritance of
her sex, the queen-bee, seems often at the fountain-head of the
revolution.&nbsp; Sometimes, undoubtedly, it is she who first
develops this longing, feverish unrest, and by little and little
communicates it to the whole colony.&nbsp; Here the variability
of bee-nature comes sharply into evidence.&nbsp; Some hives will
show this restless spirit for many days before the swarm issues,
while with others the great upheaval seems, as far as the mass of
bees is concerned, to be a sudden unpremeditated thing occurring
in the midst of the universal content and industry.&nbsp; The
preparations for raising new queens are always taken in hand
betimes, but probably this is the work of the far-seeing, sober
old bees of the hive, with whom communism has become a settled
and accepted calamity.&nbsp; The bees who will ultimately
constitute the swarm may be supposed to nourish their secret
desires from the first moment the queen shows signs of
mutability; to neglect all their old tasks, first in heart and
then in reality; and finally�when the queen�s mood
has reached its culminating point, and her work in the hive is in
virtual abeyance�to throw down plummet and trowel and hod,
and rush forth in a wild, hilarious company, urged by a longing
that they are as powerless to resist as to understand.</p>
<p>In the study of bee-life one comes upon many questions, but
seldom answers to fit all.&nbsp; If the queen�s fecundation
takes place only once in her <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>life, and nature intends this to
suffice for her whole fruitful period, it is not easy to see why
she should go out with the swarm at all.&nbsp; That she is not
the inveterate recluse as generally believed, and that she does
occasionally make short flights in the open during her laying
career, is well proved.&nbsp; The desire, therefore, to see the
light again after a long incarceration cannot be urged as her
reason for going off with the swarm.&nbsp; A much more plausible
notion is that the sexual spirit is again roused in the queen,
just as it seems to be roused for the first time in the
worker-bee; and that, with all, the journey is undertaken as a
mating-flight, a faint re-echo of a racial custom long extinct,
bearing the closest analogy to the marriage-swarm from the
ant-hill.&nbsp; It must be borne in mind that, although the
queen-bee is undoubtedly rendered capable of producing her kind
of both sexes during several years, as the result of a single
fertilisation, it cannot be incontestably held that she never
again meets the drone under any circumstances.&nbsp; There is
nothing in her physical organism to prevent a second coition,
although with the drone this is impossible, for more reasons than
the all-sufficient one�that he dies in his
marriage-hour.</p>
<p>In the old bee-gardens, where the �swarm in May�
is still a living, present thing, it is pleasant to sit with the
proprietor under the rosy shade of apple-boughs waiting for the
swarms to issue, and <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>�talking bees,� which is
the most nerve-soothing, soul-refreshing occupation in the
world.&nbsp; There never was a bee-keeper, new style or old
style, too busy to talk, provided that you met him with
understanding, and were as impatient as he of digressions from
the all-important theme.&nbsp; One soon gets tired of imparting
information as to the wonders of hive-life to the ignorant and
plainly apprehensive stranger, and none sooner than he of the old
school.&nbsp; In the quietest apiary of pure-bred English bees
there are always a few individuals of crotchety nature, who will
search you out in the shady orchard seat, and, as like as not,
knife you on the least provocation.&nbsp; If you are a beeman,
you treat these vindictive approaches with unconcern.&nbsp; You
go on listening to the old man�s talk, while the bee
shrills away at your eyelids, or creeps into your ear and out
again.&nbsp; If you keep quiet, she will soon relinquish the dull
sport, and wing harmlessly away; and the thread of the
master�s discourse is not interrupted.&nbsp; But the
uninformed stranger is a nuisance at these solitudes for
two.&nbsp; He flinches and shudders; makes little irritating
retreats; beats about wildly with his hands; or, if he is made of
the sternest metal, he sits rigidly upright when he should be
reclining at his ease, and turns such a painfully polite, though
distracted, ear to his informant, that the stream of talk is sure
to dry up incontinently, and he feels as little welcome as
ghostly Banquo at the feast.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>When
you have once lived among hives it is a sore thing to be without
their music.&nbsp; On warm days, winter and summer alike, there
is always this drowsy, dreamy song in the air; and dancing
without the fiddlers is no more depressing an occupation than, to
a beeman, is loitering in a garden of mere silent vegetables and
flowers.&nbsp; Sitting now under the bower of apple-blossoms and
watching for the swarms, the full sweet note from the hives comes
over to you like the very voice of serene content.&nbsp; It
pervades the sunshine.&nbsp; It gently qualifies the slow wind in
the tree-tops.&nbsp; It lifts and falls like the lilt of a
far-off summer sea.&nbsp; This is the labour-song: the song of
the swarm is very different.&nbsp; To the trained ear the
c�sura that presently comes in the midst of the music is as
clear as a pistol-shot, though you may detect no change.&nbsp;
The old bee-keeper stops short in his wandering tale about famous
honey-years of half a lifetime back, seizes key and pan, and
hurries across the garden.&nbsp; It is the old green hive again,
he tells you, as you press hard upon his heels�it is always
the old green hive that has swarmed the earliest every May for
years back.&nbsp; And forthwith the key and pan begin their
clattering ding-dong melody.</p>

<img alt="Hiving the swarm" title="Hiving the swarm" src="./The Lore of the Honey-Bee, by Tickner Edwardes_files/p182s.jpg">
</a></p>
<p>Old-fashioned bee-keeping is not always a matter of
straw.&nbsp; Box-hives, without, of course, the modern inside
furniture, have been in use nearly as long as the straw skep; and
the hives <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>in the garden are of this ancient pattern.&nbsp; The
old green hive is keeping well up to its reputation.&nbsp;
Already it is the centre of a swirling crowd of bees, and, as you
look, a dense black stream of them is pouring out of the entrance
so fast and furiously that it is almost impossible to distinguish
what they are.&nbsp; And the old wild trek-song is growing louder
and deeper with every moment, a rich vibrant tenor note unlike
any other sound in nature.&nbsp; There is no doubt at all of its
import, as you stand in the wing-darkened sunshine, caught up in
the excitement of it all, and feeling much as if you were facing
a tearing sou�-west gale.&nbsp; Every bee of the twenty or
thirty thousand volleying madly to and fro overhead, is singing
her bravest and loudest.&nbsp; There is only one meaning to the
whole gargantuan chorus.&nbsp; It is sheer jubilation melodised:
a wild, glad song of freedom, as though not a bee amongst them
had ever before set eyes on the sunshine and the wealth of an
English May.</p>
<p>The great door-key, a ponderous, antiquated piece of metal,
beats out its clanging note, and the swarm lifts higher and
higher into the blue.&nbsp; Gradually the sombre mist of bees
draws closer together, looking now like a little dark cloud
strayed from a forgotten summer storm.&nbsp; Now it sails slowly
northward, and lightens, as the sunlight is caught by the beating
wings as in a net of silver; and now it veers away into the very
eye of the sun, and changes into black, revolving tracery <a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>again;
whirring wheels within wheels of insect-life, spinning-wheels
making thread to weave the garments of a whole nation, and
humming as never spinning-wheels hummed before.</p>
<p>But the beginning of the end is nigh; the time of singing is
nearly over.&nbsp; The old beeman stops his weird tom-tomming,
throws down key and pan, and points to the topmost branch of a
young apple-sapling.&nbsp; You see a little black knot of bees
clinging to it no larger than a pigeon�s egg.&nbsp; A
moment later, and it has grown to the size of a double fist, and
another moment sees it twice this size again, as the flying bees
stream towards it from all directions.&nbsp; Now it is as big as
a quart measure, and the branch is slowly bending down under its
weight.&nbsp; In an incredibly short space of time the whole
swarm has joined the cluster; they hang together in a long,
brown, glistening, cigar-shaped mass, well-nigh touching the
ground, and the wild, merry music is over for good.</p>
<p>Gently swaying in the sunlight, lifeless and inert but for a
few restless bees that hum about it, the sight of a settled swarm
has an almost uncanny effect on most observers.&nbsp; A little
before, the whole garden was filled with its deafening, joyous
hubbub; now a strange silence has fallen, and it is impossible to
dissociate from its present state the idea of an abject
depression and disillusionment, as though the whole thing had
been but a mad escapade, of which the bees were now heartily <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>ashamed.&nbsp; If we may conceive the issue of a swarm
to be a freak of ancestral memory, the sudden irresistible
impulse to follow an old racial habit, long obsolete, it is not
difficult to account for the obvious change of mind that has now
come over the absconding host.&nbsp; Packed within the hive in a
feverish, surging multitude, disabilities were not self-evident
as they are now, tried in the light of day.</p>
<blockquote><p>�Violent delights have violent ends,<br>
And, in their triumph, die.�</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now there is the morrow to be thought of: life to be
rendered possible in all odds of weather; a home to be made; the
queen-mother to be sheltered�she, the one remaining
possession of the crowd, beggared now, but so rich a moment
before.&nbsp; There is hard work ahead, enough to sober the
giddiest among them.&nbsp; The madness has gone as quickly as it
came, and now the honey-bee is to show herself a reasoning
creature, if never before.</p>
<p>It is believed by most bee-keepers that a swarm selects the
site of its future dwelling some time before the expedition
starts, in many cases several days earlier.&nbsp; An old trick
among cottagers is to place out empty hives in their gardens, and
these not uncommonly attract errant swarms.&nbsp; A few bees are
seen cruising about, and subjecting the hives to a close
scrutiny.&nbsp; These pioneer bees <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>disappear, and after a variable
time, from a few minutes to a few hours, or even days, a whole
army of bees suddenly descends from the sky and takes possession
of the new home.&nbsp; When the interval between the appearance
of the scouts and the arrival of the main body, is only a short
one, the reconnoitring bees have been manifestly sent out by the
clustered swarm; but in the case of long periods elapsing, the
scouts must have been sent in search of the new location before
the swarm issued.&nbsp; Probably, although the bulk of the party
is imbued with this reckless spirit alone, thinking and caring
for nothing else but the escape and the frolic, many of the older
and wiser bees undertake the matter in a temperate, businesslike
way, as they would go about any other important
hive-operation.&nbsp; In one sense, therefore, the old notion of
there being �subordinate lieutenants, captains, and
governours� in a hive may not be so very far from the
truth.&nbsp; That these scouts are actually sent out to find a
suitable site for the new colony, either before the swarm leaves
or while it is clustered in the open, is a well-established fact,
so that some of the bees at least must keep their wits about them
throughout the general chaos.</p>
<p>And with these wiser virgins must be reckoned the queen, in
spite of the fact that she joins in the public excitement and
restlessness.&nbsp; For some days before the great emigration her
work of egg-laying is largely arrested, and this retentive action
<a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>renders
her so heavy and bulky that often she can scarcely get on the
wing.&nbsp; The object of this is that she may be all the more
ready for laying when the new home is established.&nbsp; It is
also well ascertained that all swarming bees have their
honey-sacs well filled, and this loading up for the journey takes
place just before the signal for departure is given.&nbsp; There
is great variation in the behaviour of the different stocks in a
bee-garden during the swarming season, and many close observers
are unable to detect any sure signs that a particular hive is
going to swarm.&nbsp; But it appears fairly well established
that, when a swarm is imminent, nearly all the bees of that stock
remain at home, even when all other hives in the garden are in
full foraging activity.&nbsp; Such a hive gives out a peculiar
throbbing note, which suggests the noise made by a powerful
locomotive brought to a standstill, but with full steam up, and
impatient to be gone.&nbsp; Just before the issue of the swarm
there is often a curious lull in this pent-up, forceful sound,
and probably this is the moment when the travellers are lading
themselves up for the march.&nbsp; Immediately after�and
here it is difficult not to believe that a definite,
authoritative signal for the movement is given�a sudden
stir and tumult begins in the centre of the crowded hive, much
like that caused by a heavy stone cast into water.&nbsp; This
radiates swiftly in all directions until it reaches the bees near
the entrance, and then the <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>general rush for the daylight
starts.&nbsp; Where a hive is much overcrowded there will already
be a cluster of bees numbering many thousands packed tightly
together on the alighting-board, and sometimes covering the whole
face of the hive.&nbsp; But this mass melts away directly the
swarming begins, the waiting bees taking wing all but
simultaneously with the others.</p>
<p>It was anciently believed that the queen led the swarm, but
this view is not borne out by modern observation.&nbsp; As often
as not half the bees are on the wing before she makes her
appearance, and sometimes she is among the very latest to leave,
or she may decide at the last moment not to go at all.&nbsp; In
this case the bees do not cluster, but after a few minutes�
wild tarantelle in the sunshine they all troop back to the
hive.</p>
<p>When once the swarming-party has gone off, the old hive seems
to settle down to its ordinary occupations as though nothing out
of the way had happened.&nbsp; The congested state of affairs no
longer exists, but otherwise the work of the hive is proceeding
in the usual way.&nbsp; The bees left behind are mainly young
workers who have not yet commenced foraging, but there is always
a fair sprinkling of old workers and drones.&nbsp; Generally the
hive is queenless for the time being, the new queen not having
yet broken from her cell.&nbsp; There may be four or five
queen-cells in various stages of development, or rarely as many
as a dozen.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the first of the queens
will be already hatched and wandering over the combs, meeting, as
usual at this stage of her career, perfect indifference from all
she encounters.&nbsp; But hives have been known to send off a
swarm when the preparations for raising a new queen have been
scarcely begun.&nbsp; So variable is the honey-bee in all her
ways.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>If
the objects of swarming were merely to relieve the congestion in
the hive, and to change the mother-bee, the whole thing should
now be at an end.&nbsp; But the swarming impulse is rooted in far
deeper soil than mere expediency.&nbsp; With some strains of bees
the fever seems to die out after the one attack, and the stock
settles down quietly to work for the rest of the season.&nbsp;
But more often than not this first taste of adventure serves only
to whet the national appetite for more.&nbsp; About nine days
after the first swarm leaves another swarm often follows, and
this may be succeeded by a third or even a fourth at a few
days� interval, resulting in some cases in the almost
complete extinction of the stock.&nbsp; The old skeppists called
the second swarm a �cast,� the third was a
�colt,� and the fourth a �filly.�&nbsp;
It is difficult to understand how, in a community where
individual interest is so ruthlessly sacrificed to the general
good, this self-destructive policy should be permitted.&nbsp; But
taking the view that swarming is in the main a vague and
incomplete resurrection <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>of a long obsolete habit in
bee-life, a workable theory at once suggests itself.&nbsp; Under
prim�val conditions the continued life of the mother-colony
may have been unnecessary.&nbsp; Its purpose may have been fully
served when a number of young queens and drones had been raised,
and the whole had swarmed out together, each to form a new
settlement.&nbsp; It must be remembered that the bee-hive,
persisting indefinitely from year to year, is really quite a
modern creation, and became practicable only with the invention
of the movable comb-frame, which allowed the bee-master to effect
the renewal of combs.&nbsp; It has been seen that the brood-combs
get gradually choked up with the pupa-cocoons, which each bee
leaves behind it.&nbsp; These webs are so incredibly thin that a
dozen of them make little appreciable difference to the capacity
of the cell, and combs have been known to remain in use for
brood-raising as long as twenty years.&nbsp; But eventually they
must become useless; and then, as bees do not, or cannot, remove
old combs to make way for new, the community must leave for a new
home, or gradually die out.&nbsp; Thus the age of the old hives
was definitely limited.</p>
<p>Modern beemanship has wrought many other changes in the life
of the honey-bee in addition to creating the permanent
hive-city.&nbsp; The number of bees in a single strong stock,
housed in a modern frame hive, is probably three times as great
as that <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>of a wild colony.&nbsp; The work of the bee-master
affects almost every aspect of bee-life, enlarging the scale and
the scope of all that the bees attempt.&nbsp; The result of this
is seen not only in an increased population and more extensive
works, but in a change in the very systems of life.&nbsp; Plans
that work very well on a small scale do not always succeed on a
large.&nbsp; The sanitary problems of a city are necessarily very
different from those of a village, in principle as well as in
degree.&nbsp; And probably much of the ingenuity of system and
device observable in modern hive-life is directly due to human
agency, the new conditions introduced by the bee-master serving
to educate the bees to greater effort and resource.</p>
<p>The behaviour of these after-swarms offers a curious contrast
to that of the first one.&nbsp; If it were possible to point to
one fixed and invariable law in bee-life, it would be to the fact
that a prime swarm will leave the hive only on a fine, warm day,
and generally about noon.&nbsp; But casts and colts and fillies
seem to take no count of time or weather, issuing just as the
mood besets them, early or late, and caring nothing, apparently,
for the conditions abroad.&nbsp; It is even on record that once a
second swarm came off at midnight, when the moon was at the full
and the weather very clear and warm.</p>
<p>There seems altogether much more method in the madness that
seizes on a colony swarming for <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the first time, and if thereafter
the hive settles down to its old courses, the national character
for sobriety and industry soon rehabilitates itself.&nbsp; But it
is just the strength of this public inclination towards order and
labour which varies so greatly in different hives.&nbsp; How
matters are likely to go can be readily ascertained by setting
careful watch on the hive from the day the first swarm
leaves.&nbsp; There are sure to be several queen-cells, some
capped over and almost ready to hatch out, and others in various
stages of development.&nbsp; All these cells are constantly and
assiduously guarded by the worker-bees, because directly one of
the queens is hatched, her first thought is to make a speedy end
to all future rivalry by murdering her sisters.&nbsp; She comes
from her cell evidently spoiling for a fight, and imbued to the
core with that inveterate hatred of her kind which is the ruling
passion of her existence.</p>
<p>That worker-bees and queen-bees should have an identical
origin, and yet that the nature of the one is to live in perfect
harmony, while the nature of the other is to be at perpetual war,
is one of those mysterious things in bee-life which probably will
never be explained.&nbsp; If the queen-bee of to-day can be
really taken as an approximate type of the aboriginal female of
her race, it is not difficult to understand that after her
generation in force the communal life of the mother-stock would
become an impossibility, and that with the <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>mating-swarm its natural existence was brought to a
close, much as we see it happen in wasp-life.</p>
<p>It is during the quiet nights, after the issue of a swarm,
that the peculiar shrill voice of the queen is most frequently
heard.&nbsp; As she strives with the guards that surround the
cells of the other young queens as yet unliberated, she
continually utters this quick piping cry, and is immediately
answered by the smothered cries of the imprisoned ones, who are
just as anxious as she for the fray.&nbsp; If the swarming-fever
is not yet allayed in the hive, this war-cry is bandied to and
fro unceasingly; and the general ferment deepens, until, the
condition of things having seemingly grown intolerable, the young
queen rushes out, followed by the greater number of the
bees.&nbsp; In the case of after-swarms, the concensus of
evidence is in favour of the belief that the queen is really the
leader of the party, although here again no positive rule is
observed.</p>
<p>It may happen, however, that the stock is sick of all the
turbulence and unrest that have so long beset it, and that the
general desire is to restore the <i>status quo</i>.&nbsp; Under
these conditions the sounds from the hive may have a very
different quality and meaning.&nbsp; The queen still sends forth
her shrill challenge, but now her cry is immediately followed by
a curious hissing sound from the bees.&nbsp; It is exactly as if
they were shouting her down, compelling her to silence by their
own uproar; <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>and when the war-cry of the first liberated queen is
thus met by a chorus of disapprobation, it seldom happens that
the stock swarms again.&nbsp; In a few days the queen goes forth
alone on her honeymooning adventures; and on her return she is
allowed to indulge her penchant for sororicide to her
heart�s content.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE COMB-BUILDERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the foregoing chapters an
attempt has been made to show that the honey-bee lives and moves
and has her being in a world which must be actuated by something
better than mere instinct, in the common usage of the term.&nbsp;
To the modern biologist�the earnest out-of-door student of
life under all its manifestations�this may appear as a
rather obvious and unnecessary gilding of gold, and the only
question yet undecided may seem to be where in the scale of
reason the honey-bee is to find her equitable place.</p>
<p>All bee-lovers must plead guilty to an inveterate
partizanship, the writer frankly among their number.&nbsp; There
is no laodiceanism in bee-craft; and, all the world over, it may
be said that, where a few beehives have been got together, there
is always to be found a red-hot enthusiast not far off.&nbsp; The
word �freemasonry,� in the English tongue, has grown
to be a synonym for the truest fraternity; but just as real, and
almost as far-reaching, is the brotherhood among keepers of
bees.&nbsp; No doubt, <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>among themselves the tendency is
rather to magnify the virtues and achievements of their charges:
to be over-lavish of inference from too scanty or too isolated
facts.&nbsp; And the proved impossibility of having anything to
do with the honey-bee without being carried away sooner or later
on a high wave of enthusiasm, makes any attempt at holding the
balances truly between the zealous bee-lover and the interested
but temperate-minded reader, a difficult and delicate task.&nbsp;
Any writer on the honey-bee nowadays must be reckoned an
ultra-specialist in an age of specialism; and here it is not easy
to preserve the sense of proportion undimmed, especially for one
admittedly speaking out of the ranks of beemanship, where all are
aiders and abettors in ardour, impatient of any estimation
falling short of high-water mark.</p>
<p>The story of the Comb-Builders, however, sets none of the
usual pitfalls in the way of the over-enthusiastic penman.&nbsp;
In its soberest incident and least important detail it is so
wonderful, that exuberance of language is as powerless to
exaggerate, as a niggardly tongue to minimise, its true and due
effect.&nbsp; If the ordering of the bee-commonwealth�the
intricate systems of sanitation, division of labour, treatment of
the queen and worker-larva, and the like�is subject for
marvel, and seems infallibly to denote the possession of high
faculties, a much greater degree of acumen must be conceded to
the worker-bee when we come to <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>consider her as the designer and
builder of honeycomb.</p>
<p>It is here that she shines in her most significant
light.&nbsp; The complicated structures with which she fills the
bee-city do not call for unwearying toil alone: they could never
have been fashioned unless the combined arts of engineer,
architect, and mathematician had been brought to bear on
them.&nbsp; Nor are they merely simple constructive and
mathematical problems which the honey-bee is called upon to face;
nor, though difficult, unvarying, and so amenable to instinctive
solution.&nbsp; In almost every comb built we see special and
necessarily unforeseen difficulties met and triumphantly
overcome.&nbsp; In the construction of the six-sided cell, with
its base composed of three rhombs or diamonds, the bee has
adopted a form which our greatest arithmeticians admit to be the
best possible for her requirements, and she endeavours to keep to
this form wherever practicable.&nbsp; But it constantly happens,
in her work of comb-building, that local conditions interfere
with her plans; and then she will make five-sided cells, or
square cells, or triangular, or any other form, just as the need
impels her.&nbsp; It is a facile, comfortably finite thing to put
all this down to a mysterious essence called instinct, with which
the organism of the bee has been divinely dosed, as men serve
electricity to a Leyden jar.&nbsp; But it was not instinct that
made <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Wren put the steel cable round the dome of St.
Paul�s, nor instinct that lifted the crown-stones to the
top of the Great Pyramids.&nbsp; These are works of a creature
more highly equipped and instigated; yet their supremacy is all
of a piece with the honey-comb, which is made of a material
fragile, light as air, but which, by the art of the bee, becomes
capable not only of supporting, but of suspending a weight thirty
times as great as its own.</p>
<p>That the bee does not collect her building materials, but
derives them from her own body, is a fact that has come to light
only within the last hundred and fifty years or so, although
several shrewd guesses at the truth are to be found in the works
of the medi�val bee-masters.&nbsp; The wasp, who has much
of the ingenuity of the honey-bee, but is doomed to exercise it
in a far more humble direction, makes a six-sided cell; but her
matter is collected from outside, and can only be put to
comparatively simple uses, as it is incapable of bearing tensile
strain.&nbsp; Beeswax alone, of all constructive materials in the
world, seems to meet every requirement.&nbsp; It can be worked
into plates as thin as the 1/180th part of an inch, which is the
normal thickness of the cell-wall.&nbsp; It is indestructible to
all the elements save heat.&nbsp; It can be rendered soft and
easily workable, or allowed to harden, while still retaining its
suppleness and life.&nbsp; It is a bad conductor of heat, and
therefore conserves the heat <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>of the hive.&nbsp; Vermin do not
prey upon it: so far as is known there is only one creature that
will eat it�a peculiar kind of moth-larva, against which,
however, a strong stock can always hold its own.&nbsp; And then,
as the raw materials for its production are secretions of the
bee�s own body, the work of preparing it can be carried on
when darkness or stress of weather have put an end, for the time
being, to work out of doors.</p>
<p>The first labour undertaken by a swarm, directly it has gained
possession of its new quarters, is the building of combs.&nbsp;
The apparent revulsion of feeling which succeeds the excitement
of swarming soon passes off, and the energies of the whole party
are at once concentrated on furnishing and victualling the new
hive.&nbsp; The older bees commence foraging, each bee as she
goes forth hovering a moment with her head towards the hive, to
fix its location and appearance in her memory.&nbsp; By far the
greater portion, however, remain at home and unite in a dense
cluster for wax-making.&nbsp; Time is everything in these first
operations of the new colony.&nbsp; The queen, with whom
egg-laying has probably been suspended for a day past, or even
longer, is overburdened with fecundity, and must be supplied with
thousands of brood-cells without delay.&nbsp; The foragers will
be coming home laden with nectar and pollen, and will need
instant storage-room.&nbsp; Wax must be made with all possible
expedition, and the young bees crowd together in <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>the roof of
the hive, with their queen snug and warm in their midst.</p>
<p>No doubt one of the chief reasons why swarming bees unite
themselves in the solid pendant mass of the cluster so soon after
leaving the parent-hive, is to hasten this process of
wax-formation.&nbsp; It has been proved that wax is most easily
generated under the influence of great heat, and this is well
secured in the heart of the cluster.&nbsp; By the time the scouts
have decided on the new home, and the swarm must rise again on
the wing, a great number of the bees will have their wax-pockets
filled, and will be ready for the work of comb-making.&nbsp; When
a swarm is hived, even if it be only a short time after its
issue, the little white wax-scales can be seen protruding from
the armour-joints of many of the bees, and these are often
dropped and lost in the general confusion.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things to observe in bee-life is the
actual process of comb-building.&nbsp; The crush is so great, and
the movement of the bees so incessant, that at first the comb
seems to grow of itself rather than be made by the busy
multitude, for ever obscuring it from the watcher�s eyes,
or giving him but the rarest glimpse now and then of its white,
delicate frailty of pattern.&nbsp; These early efforts of the
comb-builders, produced as they are under forced circumstances,
are occasionally faulty of design, as though hastily knocked
together.&nbsp; Sometimes the first groups of cells made <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>by a swarm
will have a yellow, moist, spongy appearance, with thick,
irregular walls, and are obviously little more than temporary
vats to hold the incoming nectar until the proper honey-cells can
be constructed.&nbsp; This emergency-comb is specially
interesting, as affording one more instance of the
worker-bee�s ever-ready resource in the presence of
difficulties.&nbsp; In the ordinary way the mason-bee hangs
quietly in the cluster until her wax-secreting organs have done
their work, and the six little oblong scales of brittle material
are ready for manipulation.&nbsp; These protrude from under the
hard plates of her abdomen, three on each side, looking much like
half-posted letters.&nbsp; At one of the knee joints of her
hind-leg she has a peculiar implement, of which there is not the
slightest trace in the queen-bee.&nbsp; This is like a pair of
nippers, but instead of two converging points, it is furnished on
one side with a row of sharp, stiff bristles; and on the other
with a shallow spoon.&nbsp; With this special tool the worker-bee
grips the wax-scale, and draws it out of its pocket.&nbsp; It is
then transferred to her jaws, and she hurries off with it to the
comb-building.&nbsp; Arrived at an unfinished cell, she sets to
work to chew up the raw wax into a paste, incorporating it with
her saliva, and materially increasing its bulk.&nbsp; The
resulting soft, ductile matter is then applied to the work, and
moulded into its needed shape.&nbsp; In this way, with hundreds
of workers going and coming, the delicate <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>white
fabric of brood and honey-comb is built up with extraordinary
rapidity.</p>
<p>How the coarse, spongy comb, which swarms will sometimes
manufacture, is produced cannot be definitely stated.&nbsp; It
has all the appearance of having been made from raw wax,
hurriedly masticated and kneaded up with honey, and probably this
is its actual composition.&nbsp; The secretion from the salivary
gland, is necessarily slow, and with time pressing and a horde of
impatient foragers dinning about her ears, eager to unload and be
off again to the clover, the ingenious mason-bee appears to have
hit on the idea of using the contents of her honey-sac as a
substitute.&nbsp; Nothing, however, but a mechanical admixture
can take place between honey and the raw wax.&nbsp; This
dissolves only under the influence of the bee�s saliva,
which has intensely acid properties.</p>
<p>To understand all that the bees have accomplished when a new
empty hive has been filled throughout with waxen comb, it is
necessary to follow the operations of the swarm pretty closely
during the first few weeks of its separate life.&nbsp; It is a
big undertaking, the building of an entire, new bee-city, and the
problems that confront the builders are many and
complicated.&nbsp; In the first place, whether she ever attains
it or not, the worker-bee will aim at nothing short of
perfection.&nbsp; Hereditary experience tells her exactly what
are the home-requirements of the colony, and she now sets <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>to work to
fulfil them in the best imaginable way.</p>
<p>A city is to be built which is to accommodate twenty or thirty
thousand individuals.&nbsp; Vast nursery-quarters must be
constructed, as there may be as many as ten or twelve thousand
youngsters to cradle at one and the same time.&nbsp; For at least
six months of the year no food will be obtainable from outside,
so that the city must contain large storehouses capable of
holding more than a six months� supply.&nbsp; As the
temperature in winter can be kept up only by the bodily warmth of
the inhabitants, life in the city must be concentrated into the
smallest possible space; and the materials of which the city is
built must be heat-conserving, while its construction must allow
of perfect ventilation at all times, and in summer it must permit
a free circulation of air, that the surplus heat can be readily
carried off.&nbsp; The city must be a fortress as well as a home,
and be closed in on every side as a protection against its many
enemies, as well as the weather.</p>
<p>There is another, and just as vital a condition governing its
construction�the necessity for strict economy in
material.&nbsp; If there were any natural substance having the
qualities of tenacity, lightness, ductility, and strength which
the bees could obtain out of doors instead of wax, no doubt they
would use it for comb-building, and they would not spend hours of
precious time and consume large <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>quantities of hard-won stores in the
manufacture of their own material.&nbsp; But it seems there is
nothing in nature possessing the needful properties.&nbsp; Bees
collect a resinous substance, notably from the buds of the
poplar, which they use for stopping up crevices.&nbsp; They
dilute this also into a varnish, with which they paint the
finished combs, and sometimes even combine it with wax to form a
rough filling; but it appears to be useless in
cell-construction.&nbsp; The whole city must needs be made of
wax, and wax alone; and the bees are as careful of this precious
substance as a miser of his gold.</p>
<p>Starting with these conditions�efficient
house-accommodation for the colony secured at the least cost in
time, labour, and material�the bee tackles the problem
before her with an ingenuity that is little short of
astounding.&nbsp; She appears to begin with the central dominant
unit of the difficulty, and to work outward, vanquishing
subsidiary problems as she goes.&nbsp; Her line of reasoning
seems to run somewhat in this way.&nbsp; To raise the young, and
store the honey, there is needed some kind of cell or
receptacle.&nbsp; The young larv� being cylindrical in
form, a cylindrical cell is indicated; and this shape will serve
also for the honey-barrels.&nbsp; Not a few, however, but many
thousands of these vessels will be required: they must therefore
be placed close together, as well for economy of space as for
natural warmth.&nbsp; The cells could be grouped together mouth
upwards in <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>horizontal planes, storey above storey; but such a
method of construction would be economically unsound.&nbsp; To
prevent sagging in the heat of the hive, and under the weight
they will be called to bear, the cell-bases would have to be
thickened collectively into a substantial floor, which would need
shoring-up at intervals�after the manner of the
wasps.&nbsp; But in this, much valuable material would be
diverted from its proper use.&nbsp; Obviously, a better plan
would be to lay all the cells on their sides, and pile them up
into a vertical wall.&nbsp; And, just as obviously, if two walls
of these superimposed cells were placed back to back, so that one
central vertical sheet of wax would serve to stop the ends of all
the cells, right and left, a saving of half the material used for
the cell-bottoms would at once be effected.</p>
<p>But, so far, the design is still only in its crude, initial
stage.&nbsp; The upright comb, consisting of a double pile of
round cells, back to back, with one flat base between, although a
great advance on the single sheet of horizontal cells, is yet
mechanically and economically deficient.&nbsp; The round cells
leave useless interstices, which take much wax in the filling;
while the flat bottoms do not coincide with the form of the
larv�, and thus still more space is wasted.&nbsp; Clearly,
improvement can only come by altering the shape of the cell; and
now the bee seems to have asked herself-and triumphantly
answered�an extremely complex question.</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>She
knew how much internal cell-space each larva required for
growth.&nbsp; The problem, therefore, was this: of what shape,
nearly approaching the cylindrical, ought such a cell to be made,
which would ensure the right dimensions, but which would occupy
the least possible room, have the greatest possible strength,
consume the least possible material in its manufacture, and
possess the property that a number of similar cells could be
built up in a double vertical plane, leaving no interstices
either between the cells or between the planes?</p>
<p>There is only one solution to this problem; and the honey-bee
found it�who shall say how many ages ago?�in the
hexagon cell, with its base composed of three rhombs.</p>
<p>The whole astounding ingenuity of the thing can only be
realised when a piece of nearly perfect, new-made, virgin-comb
has been closely examined.&nbsp; It will be at once seen that the
hexagon cells combine together over the surface of the comb in
absolute geometrical union, and that the six-sided form is round
enough for all practical purposes.&nbsp; Looking into the cells
on one side of the comb, it will be noted that their bases take
the form of depressed pyramids, each made up of three
diamond-shaped planes.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>Turning the comb over, we see that the cells on this
side also have pyramidal bottoms.&nbsp; If the depth of a cell on
one side of the comb be taken, and added to the depth of a cell
on the other side, and then the width of the whole comb be
measured, it will be found that the combined depth of the two
cells perceptibly exceeds the width of the whole comb.&nbsp; At
first glance this seems like a case of the less including the
greater, which is a manifest impossibility.&nbsp; But, holding
the comb up to the light, a further discovery is made, and the
seeming paradox is eliminated.&nbsp; The bottoms of the cells are
so thin as to be almost transparent, and it is at once seen that
the cells are not built end to end, in line, but that each
cell-base on one side of the comb covers part of three cell-bases
on the other.&nbsp; If the three diamonds, composing between them
the triangular base of a single cell, be perforated with a
needle, and the comb turned over, it will be found that the three
perforations come each in a separate cell.&nbsp; Thus the saving
in the total width of the comb is effected by allowing the
pyramidal bases on each side to engage alternately like the teeth
of a trap; instead of meeting point-blank, they overlap each
other, and the faces of the pyramids are so contrived that each
of them helps to close two cells.</p>
<p>There is another advantage in this arrangement which will be
immediately obvious.&nbsp; The apex and three ribs of each
pyramidal cell-base form foundation-lines for the cell-walls on
the other side of the comb.&nbsp; This means that not only do all
cell-walls abut on an arch, but that every cell-base <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>is
strengthened throughout by a triple girdering.&nbsp; The result
is that the amount of wax required in the construction of the
comb can be everywhere reduced to an absolute minimum.&nbsp; It
becomes merely a question of what thickness of wax will retain
the honey; and this experience proves to be no more than 1/180
part of an inch.&nbsp; The whole thing, indeed, might very well
be taken as an ideal exemplar of the triumph of mind over
matter.</p>
<p>The geometric principles brought into play in the construction
of honey-comb have been a favourite study with mathematicians of
all ages, and especially this rhombiform method adopted by the
bee in flooring her cells.&nbsp; The rhomb is best described as a
plane-figure whose four sides are equal, like those of a square,
but whose angles are not right angles.&nbsp; In such a figure
there are necessarily two greater angles and two smaller, facing
each other in pairs.&nbsp; The three rhombs composing the base of
the honey-cell lean together, as has been seen, in the form of a
blunt pyramid; and�treating all angles as negligible
factors�the bluntness of this pyramid is found to coincide
very aptly with the shape of the full-grown larv�.&nbsp;
But this is not the only reason for the particular inclination
given by the bee to the rhombs forming the base of each
cell.&nbsp; Economy rules here, as in everything else she
undertakes; and the truth that she has chosen the one and only
form of cell-base <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>which takes the least possible material to construct
has received very striking confirmation.</p>
<p>The story is an old and famous one, but it will bear
repeating.&nbsp; A great naturalist once put himself to an
infinity of trouble in measuring the angles formed by the rhombs
in a vast number of comb-cell bases, and he found that these
showed remarkable uniformity.&nbsp; It will be clear that the
hollow pyramid of the cell-bottom will be either deep or shallow,
according to the shape of the three rhombs composing it.&nbsp;
The apex of the pyramid is formed by the meeting of three equal
angles, one from each rhomb; and it is plain that this apex will
be sharp or blunt, according to whether the meeting angles are
wide or narrow.&nbsp; It was, of course, impossible to ascertain
the dimensions of these angles with absolutely microscopical
nicety; but, dealing only with the most perfect comb, the
naturalist found that the two greater angles in the rhombs
measured very nearly 110�, and the two lesser angles
70�.&nbsp; He also found that the angles formed by the
conjunction of the cell-sides with the bases had the same
dimensions as those of the rhombs.&nbsp; Assuming therefore that,
mathematically, the angles of the rhombs and cell-sides should be
equal, he was able to calculate exactly the angles for which the
bees were evidently striving in the construction of the
rhombs�109� 28&#8242; and 70� 32&#8242;.</p>
<p>Another bee-lover scientist, ruminating over <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>these
figures, was much impressed by them, and determined to find out
the reason why the bee made such constant choice of this
particular shape of rhomb.&nbsp; He therefore conceived the idea
of submitting the bee�s judgment on this cell-base question
to an independent authority.&nbsp; Without disclosing his object,
he propounded the following problem to one of the greatest
mathematicians of the day.</p>
<p>�Supposing,� said he, in effect, �you were
required to close the end of an hexagonal vessel by three rhombs
or diamond-shaped plates, what angles must be given to these
rhombs so that the greatest amount of space would be enclosed by
the least amount of material?�</p>
<p>It was a difficult problem, but the mathematician worked it
out at last, and his answer was �109� 26&#8242; and
70� 34.�</p>
<p>Now, the difference between the calculation of the man and the
calculation of the bee was an exceedingly small one.&nbsp; No one
thought of calling into question the work of the man, who was
pre-eminent in his world of figures.&nbsp; It was therefore
accepted as a fact that the bee had made a trifling
mistake�so trifling, however, that, in the matter of
comb-building, it was of no importance.&nbsp; Her reputation was
unimpaired: to all intents and purposes the honey-cell was still
a perfect example of utmost capacity secured by least
material.</p>
<p>But another mathematician�a Scotsman this
time�went over the whole business again, and he <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>proved
conclusively that the bee was right, while the first
mathematician was wrong.&nbsp; He showed that the true answer to
the problem of the angles was 109� 28&#8242; and 70�
32&#8242;�identically the figures obtained by estimation of
the honey-comb.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the foregoing pages the principles involved in the
construction of honey-comb have been gone into rather minutely,
because it is here that the lines of thought between the old and
the new naturalists seem to make a typical divergence.&nbsp; Both
schools are, in the main, agreed on the point that all forms of
life emanate from the one omnipotent source; and it matters
little whether we speak of the vast periods of time, during which
the creation of all things was effected, as ages, or under the
old Biblical metaphor of days.&nbsp; But whereas the old school
appears to insist on different qualities of life�immortal
soul in man, and a mystic, subconscious, perishable thing called
instinct in the brute creation�the new school is unable to
see any distinction between the intellectual equipment of man and
brute, but that of degree.&nbsp; Between the honey-bee and her
masters there is indeed a great gulf fixed, but it is conceivably
not unbridgable.&nbsp; And unless we are determined at all cost
of logical violence to force a favourite set of square opinions
into the round holes of observed fact, it is difficult to see how
the old position is long to remain tenable.</p>
<p>With regard to this particular question of <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>comb-building, an attempt is still being made to show
that it is entirely due to the working of certain natural laws,
and is independent of any intelligence or volition which the bees
are supposed to exercise.&nbsp; We are told that the cells are
always begun in a circular form, but that they afterwards assume
the hexagon shape quite automatically, in obedience to the laws
of mutual interference and pressure.&nbsp; As a proof of this, it
is pointed out that the outside cells of the comb, not being
subject to these laws, are usually more or less rounded.</p>
<p>The pressure-theory is hardly worth serious consideration, as
it is obvious that the growth of a honey-comb is perfectly free
and untrammelled in every way.&nbsp; If the bee makes her
comb-cells with six sides and a pyramidal base unthinkingly, and
under the yoke of imperious obligation, it is certainly not
because the cells force this shape upon one another, like
Buffon�s peas in a bottle.</p>
<p>And if we believe that the bee works blindly under the law of
mutual interference, any close examination of the results of her
work must bring us to the conviction that we are only putting
aside one marvel for something more wonderful still.&nbsp; For
then we see a natural law taking on a very unnatural
quality�that of intelligent adaptation to
circumstances.&nbsp; The comb, intended for use in the
hive-nursery, is made in two sizes.&nbsp; That used for cradling
the worker-brood has cells measuring &#8533; inch across, and a
fraction less than � inch deep, while <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>that
designed for raising the drone-larva is built up of cells having
a diameter of � inch, and a depth of about &#8541;
inch.&nbsp; These different-sized cells are not mingled
indiscriminately over the comb, but are grouped together in large
blocks.&nbsp; Some of the combs will be entirely composed of
worker-cells, which are always in the vast majority; other combs
will be made up of both kinds.</p>
<p>The bees begin a comb by attaching a small block of wax to the
roof of the hive.&nbsp; On either side of this they hollow out
depressions, which become the bases of the first cells.&nbsp; The
work is then extended downwards and sideways, the cell-bases
being multiplied in all directions as fast as possible, so that
there are a great number of unfinished cells in progress long
before the walls of the first cells have been completed.&nbsp;
There is a very reasonable motive for this procedure.&nbsp; When
a house is being built, as much of the foundations as possible
are laid in at the commencement, to allow a large body of
bricklayers to get to work on the walls at the same time; and the
bee extends her comb-foundations on the same principle.</p>
<p>When about half the comb has been finished for worker-brood,
it may be decided to commence building drone-cells.&nbsp; As the
bases of the drone-cells are larger than those of the
worker-cells, it follows that a change must be effected in the
ground-plan of the comb.&nbsp; The bees prepare for this
transition very cleverly, evidently studying <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>how the
regularity of the comb may be least interrupted.&nbsp; Sometimes
the change is contrived without any appreciable loss of space,
but more often several misshapen cells have to be made before the
symmetrical progress of the comb is resumed.&nbsp; This depends
largely on the inherited skill of the bees, which varies
according to their strain, as all experienced bee-keepers
know.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, if the work of comb-building is carried
through by the bees under blind compulsion of the natural laws of
mutual interference and pressure, what other law, it may be
asked, interferes with these in turn when the transition from one
size of cell to another must be made?&nbsp; If it is all a sort
of crystallisation going on independently of the bees� will
or wish, it appears more than curious that the mill should grind
large or small, just as the needs of the hive demand it.</p>
<p>But the whole position is really little else than a flagrant
example of the evils of argument from a simile.&nbsp; Soaked peas
in a bottle will swell to hexagons, or rather, dodecahedrons, by
the law of mutual interference.&nbsp; Soap-bubbles will do the
same with no more constriction than their own weight.&nbsp; But
peas and bubbles are things self-contained and separately
existing, before being brought together.&nbsp; If the bees made a
vast number of separate, round cells, and then combined them
simultaneously, no doubt all but the outside cells would assume
the hexagon form.&nbsp; But the essence of the whole art and
ingenuity of comb-building lies in the fact that there is no <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>such thing
as a separate cell.&nbsp; Each single compartment in the comb
shares its parts with no less than nine other compartments.&nbsp;
And to talk of mutual interference when there is no separate
existence is ploughing the sands indeed.</p>
<p>There are other circumstances connected with the work of the
comb-builders which go far to confirm the position that bees do
exercise reason, and that of a high order.&nbsp; It has been said
that the interior of a hive in daytime is not altogether deprived
of light.&nbsp; Probably, during the hours of greatest activity,
the bees have always enough light to see their way about by means
of their wonderful indoor-eyes, which, under the microscope, have
all the solemn wisdom of an owl�s.&nbsp; It is a fact,
however, that comb-building is usually carried on at night-time,
when other employments are in temporary abeyance. Possibly
the�to our eyes�profoundest darkness may be no
darkness at all to the bees; but, to all appearances, as we can
judge of them, honey-comb is virtually made in the dark.</p>
<p>But combs are built side by side, often simultaneously.&nbsp;
They grow downwards together, yet always preserve their right
distance apart; so that, when finished, there will be an
intervening gangway between the sealed surfaces of about a
quarter of an inch, which is just enough to allow the two streams
of bees to pass each other, back <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>to back.&nbsp; How are these
distances preserved, seeing that the bees at work on the bottom
edge of each comb are separated by a space of, perhaps, an inch
and a half of empty darkness?</p>
<p>A simple experiment will at once give a clue to this.&nbsp; If
a hive, in which a swarm has constructed about half its depth of
comb, be canted a little sideways, so as to throw the combs out
of the perpendicular, and the hive be then left for several days,
it will be found on examination that all building, from the
moment of disturbance, has followed on the new line of
verticality.&nbsp; The combs will all be slightly bent to one
side.&nbsp; This means either that the bees have a natural sense
of the perpendicular, or that they work by the plumbline, as
humanity is constrained to do.&nbsp; The fact seems to be that
the hanging cluster of wax-making bees performs the office of a
living plummet, and really guides the comb in its downward
progress.</p>
<p>Yet, do bees always suspend their combs?&nbsp; Do they never
construct a waxen storehouse, raising it tier above tier from the
floor of the hive, after the system of the more intelligent
creature, Man?</p>

</a></p>
<p>The first commentary on this is, that such a departure from
their common methods would be no improvement, but a retrograde
step.&nbsp; These long comb-walls of the bees have a close
analogy to the modern transatlantic sky-scraper building.&nbsp;
The trouble with all such buildings is to provide <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>them with
sufficient base for their height.&nbsp; If American engineers had
at their disposal a material of adequate tensile strength, and
there were anything in nature to hang them from, it would be,
scientifically, a better plan to suspend these buildings than to
erect them, because the house would then naturally tend to keep
its verticality, and the base-problem would cease to exist.&nbsp;
On the same principle the bees, having at hand a material of
almost ideal tensility, and a suitable hanging-beam, wisely
suspend their heavily, weighted combs from the roof, instead of
erecting them, like certain kinds of ant-structures.</p>
<p>But it is undoubtedly long racial experience, and not
inability to follow the humanly approved method, that guides them
here.&nbsp; Rarely�so rarely that the writer, in the course
of many years spent among bees, has seen only a single example of
it�bees will build comb <i>upwards</i>, if circumstances
will allow no other way.&nbsp; And this would seem not only to
drive the last coffin-nail for the poor instinct-theory, but to
carve its epitaph as well.</p>
<p>In the instance referred to, a glass-bottomed box had been
inverted over the feed-hole of a common hive, and had there
remained forgotten.&nbsp; As the season progressed, the hive grew
great with bees and honey, and it became imperative to build
additional store-comb in the box overhead.&nbsp; But its slippery
glass roof would give no foothold to the builders.&nbsp; Time and
again they must have <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>tried to get upon it, with their
wax-hods filled and ready, and each time failed: the ordinary way
of comb-building was clearly impossible.&nbsp; Then the engineers
of the hive, inspired by the difficulty, got to work in another
way.&nbsp; On the wooden surface below they laid out the plan of
a garner-house, not after their usual method of parallel combs,
but a regular, oblong house, with cellular storerooms, and
communicating passages in between.&nbsp; Upon this they raised
storey above storey of horizontal cells, until the glass roof was
nearly reached.&nbsp; At this stage, apparently, the honey-flow
came to an end in the fields, for the cells in the store-house
were never sealed, though all were nearly full of honey; and
later in the season it was found and carried away by the
bee-master, who still preserves it as a curiosity.&nbsp; He bears
a well-known name, <a name="citation218"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/64532/64532-h/64532-h.htm#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a> and his testimony
as to the making of this unique little honey-house is beyond
question; but, indeed, it carries in itself infallible evidence
of its authenticity.&nbsp; All honey-cells made by bees have a
slight upward inclination, which helps, as has been already
explained, to retain their contents until they can be capped
over.&nbsp; And every cell in the storehouse clearly showed this
upward slant.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">WHERE THE BEE SUCKS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is characteristic of those
unlettered in bee-craft that they are often afraid when there is
no danger, and will venture with the intrepidity that is born of
ignorance where old experienced bee-keepers fear to tread.</p>
<p>Temper in bees is one of the most variable qualities in a
creature made up of variabilities.&nbsp; There are times, when a
summer storm is threatening and the air is charged with
electricity, when to go among the bees is to court certain
disaster; and there are other times, such as the full height of
the honey-flow, when almost any liberties can be taken with bees,
without fear of reprisals.&nbsp; And yet this is not always the
rule.&nbsp; Much depends on their lineage and the purity of the
strain, and, again, on the systems of the bee-master.&nbsp; Bees
respond as readily as any other form of domestic stock to wise
and considerate treatment.&nbsp; Handled in a firm, quiet,
deliberate way, the most vicious colony can often be dealt with
in perfect safety; while the mildest-natured bees will commonly
<a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>meet
fumbling indexterity with a prompt challenge to war.</p>
<p>Since the Italian bee was brought to England, some
half-century ago, there is no doubt that the original English
strain has been greatly modified.&nbsp; Some authorities, indeed,
question whether there are any absolutely pure British bees left
at all.&nbsp; The golden girdles of the Italian crop up in the
most unlikely places, and the foreign blood seems to have got
into the race in all but the remotest parts of the country.&nbsp;
One must regret, although it is a vain regret now, that these
undesirable aliens were ever allowed to set foot on the
soil.&nbsp; Whatever naturally survives and thrives in a
particular country, must be the most suitable thing for that
country; and these southern races of the honey-bee seem to have
brought back, to the detriment of our own stock, idiosyncrasies
long ago bred out of the native race.&nbsp; Much of the nervous
irritability and proneness to disease visible in the honey-bee of
to-day is more or less directly traceable to the introduction of
foreign blood; and the grand special advantage of the Italian
bee�its much vaunted and widely advertised possession of a
long tongue�has proved an entire myth.&nbsp; Numberless
measurements undertaken by our leading scientific apiarians have
proved that the Italian bee has a tongue no longer than any
other, although most are willing to concede her the possession of
a very long and ready sting indeed.&nbsp; <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>But here we
do her an injustice: a pure-bred Italian worker-bee is as good or
as bad tempered as any other of her species.&nbsp; It is the
first crosses with the native bee which display so much
vindictive aggressiveness, and have given to the whole race its
general bad name.</p>
<p>In the time of the great honey-flow�which in southern
England begins in May, early or late, according to the season,
and may endure for six weeks�it is a common thing in the
country to see people turn back from the footpaths, running
through the white-clover or sainfoin fields, because of the huge
and terrifying uproar made by the foraging bees.&nbsp; When there
is a large acreage under these crops, and the day is a fair one,
this note reaches a volume hardly to be credited as a sound of
work and peace.&nbsp; It is much more like the din of a great
bee-war, and it is small wonder that the stranger, unlearned in
the ways of the hives, should fear to go through what is very
like a scene of battle and carnage.</p>
<p>And yet there is no time of year when the honey-bee is so
little inclined to molest her human fellow-creatures as
this.&nbsp; So long as the honey-weather holds�the warm
nights when the nectar is secreted, and the rainless days when it
can be gathered�she can hardly be induced to attack, even
if her home is being turned inside out, and the sudden sunlight
riddling its darkness through and through.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>Until
within comparatively recent years it was universally believed
that honey was a pure, untouched secretion from the flowers; and
that beyond gathering and storing it the bee had no part in its
production.&nbsp; This idea, however, is a wholly mistaken
one.&nbsp; Honey is a manufactured article, and differs in almost
every way from the raw juices obtained from the various
flower-crops.&nbsp; The nectar of flowers, before collection by
the bee, seems to have hardly any of the constituents of ripe
honey.&nbsp; Three-quarters of its bulk consists of plain water,
in which about 20 per cent. of cane-sugar is dissolved, the rest
being made up of essential oils and gums, which give it its
distinctive flavour.&nbsp; But mature honey contains very little
water, certainly never more than a sixth part of its bulk.&nbsp;
Its sugar is almost entirely grape-sugar.&nbsp; It is decidedly
acid, while the nectar is always neutral.&nbsp; And the oils and
aromatic principles of the flower juices are matured and
developed into the well-known honey flavour, which is like
nothing else in the world.</p>
<p>It is certain that the process of manufacture begins directly
the bee draws the nectar from the flower-cup.&nbsp; As the liquid
passes into the honey-sac it is mingled with the acid secretion
from the gland at the base of the tongue.&nbsp; When the bee
reaches the hive she does not pour her burden direct into the
cells, but passes it on to one of the house-bees, who conveys it
to the honey-vats.&nbsp; It is even probable that the nectar is
transferred a <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>second time before it reaches the cell, although this
point is still undecided.&nbsp; The effect of such transference
is to add more acid properties to the original juice.</p>
<p>The honey seems to undergo a regular brewing process within
the hive.&nbsp; It is kept at a temperature of about 80� or
85�, and it is then that the surplus water passes off into
vapour.&nbsp; In this way the raw nectar loses at least
two-thirds of its natural bulk before it is finally converted
into honey.&nbsp; It is said that at the last moment, just before
each cell is stopped with an impervious covering of wax, the bee
turns herself about, and injects into the honey a drop of the
poison from her sting; but there seems to be not the slightest
evidence in support of this.&nbsp; The contents of the poison-sac
are, it is true, mainly formic acid, which is a strong
preservative; and undoubtedly traces of formic acid are to be
found in all honeys.&nbsp; It has been, however, conclusively
proved that this acid finds its way into the honey from the
glandular system of the bee, and not through its sting.</p>
<p>The industry of the bee in nectar-gathering has always been a
stock subject for wonder, and it is commonly supposed that she is
born with full instinctive capabilities for her task.&nbsp; A
little observation, however, soon tends to upset this
theory.&nbsp; The work of foraging has to be learnt step by step,
like every other species of skilled work in hive-life.&nbsp; The
young bee, setting out on her first flight, has all the will to
do well, and her imitative <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>faculty is strongly developed; but
she seems to have very little else.&nbsp; Her first experiences
are a succession of blunders.&nbsp; She appears not to know for
certain where to look for the coveted sweets, and can be seen
industriously searching the most unlikely places�crevices
in walls, tufts of grass, or the leaves of a plant instead of its
flowers.&nbsp; The fact that the nectar is hidden deep down in
the cup of the flower, beyond its pollen-bearing mechanism, seems
to dawn upon her only after much thought and many fruitless
essays.</p>
<p>It has been proved that bees will go as far as two or even
three miles in their foraging journeys.&nbsp; The distance seems
to vary according to the nature of the country.&nbsp; Bees in
hilly districts appear to venture only short distances from home,
while in flat country the foraging flights are more
extended.&nbsp; A bee-line has become proverbial for a straight
course, but it is doubtful whether the bee ever makes a perfectly
direct flight from point to point.&nbsp; The truth seems to be
that there are well-defined air-paths out from and home to every
bee-garden, and that these are continually thronged with bees
going and returning throughout the working hours of the
day.&nbsp; These a�rial thoroughfares lie high above all but
the tallest obstacles, so high indeed that the keenest sight will
reveal nothing.&nbsp; Only the busy song of the travellers can be
heard, like a river of music, far overhead.</p>
<p>In the South Down country, where the isolated <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>farms are
each surrounded with their compact acreage of blossoming
sheep-feed, and there is nothing but empty miles of close-cropped
turf between, these bee-roads in the air can be easily found and
studied.&nbsp; Walking over the springy, undulating grass in the
quiet of a summer�s morning, a faint, far-off note breaks
suddenly upon you like the twang of a harp-string high up in the
blue.&nbsp; A step or two onward and you lose it; retracing your
path, it peals out again.&nbsp; You can see nothing, strain your
eyes as you will; but its cause is evident, and with a little
trying you can presently make out the main direction of the
flight, and see down in the hollow far below, the huddled roofs
of a farmstead with a patchwork of fields about it, white with
clover, or rose-red with sainfoin in fullest bloom.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no honey in the world so fine as that to be
obtained from these solitary Downland settlements.&nbsp; With the
ordinary consumer honey is merely honey, and there is an end of
the matter.&nbsp; But the beeman knows that the quality of honey
varies as greatly as that of wine.&nbsp; He will tell you at
first taste the crop from which it is gathered, whether it has
one source or many, whether it is all flower-essence, or has been
contaminated by the hateful honeydew, which is not honey at
all.&nbsp; Down in the lowlands, except at certain rare seasons
when only one crop is in flower, it is next to impossible to get
honey <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>absolutely from a single source.&nbsp; But here on the
hills the bees are not tempted by glowing gardens with their
feeble, washy sweets; nor are they led aside by the
coarse-natured privet, or horse-chestnut, or sunflower.&nbsp;
There is only one trencher to their banquet, but this is a vast,
illimitable one.&nbsp; They have nothing to do but to wend out
and home all day long between their hives and a single field.</p>
<p>It is difficult to gauge with anything like approximate truth
the amount of honey that one flowering crop will yield.&nbsp; But
probably, when all conditions are most favourable, every acre of
Dutch clover will produce about five pounds of pure honey for
each day it is left standing in full bloom.&nbsp; The nectar is
obviously secreted by the flower as an attraction to the bee,
who, blundering into it with her pollen-smothered body,
unconsciously effects its fertilisation.&nbsp; Directly this
object is gained, the flow of nectar in each particular floret
appears to cease, and the bee passes it by.</p>
<p>The student of old books on apiculture is often surprised to
read so much in praise of honeydew, while in the modern
bee-garden he hears of it nothing but hearty condemnation.&nbsp;
He is told that directly the bees begin to gather honeydew the
store-racks must be removed from the hives, or the good honey
will be ruined both in colour and flavour.&nbsp; He is shown some
dark, ill-looking, watery stuff carefully sealed up by the bees,
and is informed that it is nearly all honeydew.&nbsp; But, <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>he asks
himself, can this be the same thing about which the old masters
were led into such ardent eulogy?&nbsp; The truth is that when
ancient and medi�val writers spoke of honeydew, they used
the word as a general term for all that the bees gathered.&nbsp;
Honey was all a dew, divinely rained down from the skies; and it
is entirely of a piece with the all but universal lack of
bee-knowledge down almost to the beginning of the nineteenth
century, that so few should have guessed that the flowers
themselves had anything to do with the matter.&nbsp; Virgil and
the rest of the classics held absolute sway over all minds
pretending to the least culture, and even the naturalists seem to
have studied the wild life around them with no other object than
to force facts into line with ancient poetic fantasies.&nbsp; The
old writers explained the varying qualities of honey as being due
to the influence of whatever stars happened to be in the
ascendant at the time of its gathering, and the honey was good or
bad according to whether this was favourable or unfavourable.</p>
<p>The quality and consistency of honey varies extraordinarily as
between the different sources of true nectar; but there is no
doubt that honeydew well merits the evil name it has gained with
modern bee-keepers.&nbsp; There are, perhaps, three hundred
distinct kinds of aphides known to English naturalists, and all
these eject the sweet liquid which, under certain conditions,
bees are tempted <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>to gather.&nbsp; This honeydew varies in flavour
according to the species of tree from whose sap it is
derived.&nbsp; Probably much of it is only a sweet, slightly
mawkish liquor, which, in its pure state, combines with the
genuine honey without causing noticeable deterioration, at least
to the unexpert taste and eye.&nbsp; But, unfortunately for
bee-keepers, the oak is a great favourite with these parasites,
no fewer than six varieties preying on this one tree alone.&nbsp;
And oak-honeydew is a pestilent thing indeed.</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that the first cold nights, that mark
the beginning of the end of the honey season, stimulate the
production of honeydew; for it is after a chilly night that bees
are usually seen at work on the trees where the aphides
abound.&nbsp; A much more likely theory, however, is that the
cold does not accelerate the secretion of the honeydew, but cuts
off the more legitimate resources of the hive just when they are
in fullest activity; and so the huge armies of foragers are
momentarily thrown out of work, and must seek new outlets for
their energy.&nbsp; The secretion of true nectar takes place
mainly at night, and requires a temperature of about
70�.&nbsp; Anything much lower than this means dearth on the
morrow, no matter how fine and warm the weather may then
prove.</p>
<p>The dark colour of aphis-syrup�a very little of which
will ruin for market the finest honey�seems <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>to be due
as much to foreign matter as to its natural evil character.&nbsp;
There is a peculiar growth on the bark of many trees where
aphides congregate, which is known as soot-fungus.&nbsp; This and
the honeydew get mingled together in a cimmerian slime, and, no
doubt, the merest trace of it would serve to darken and spoil the
purest honey.&nbsp; There seems to be no way for bee-keepers but
to watch for the first chilly nights, as the honey-season draws
towards its close; and then to be up early and get the surplus
honey-chambers off the hives, before the bees have had a chance
to spoil them.&nbsp; But the bee is no desperately early riser,
for all her lofty place in the moral-maxim books.&nbsp; She
generally waits until the morning sun has drunk up the night
dews, and warmed the flower-calyces, before getting down to her
work in earnest.&nbsp; The very early bees that may sometimes be
seen winging out into the first light of a summer�s
morning, are probably only water-carriers.&nbsp; The water-supply
is the day�s first and last care with each hive in the
breeding season.&nbsp; Every bee-garden seems to have its regular
watering-place, generally on the oozy margin of some neighbouring
pond; and here, in the early morning, and again towards late
afternoon, the bees may be seen drinking in whole battalions,
while the meridian hours of the day will find it all but
deserted.&nbsp; Curiously, these water-fetching times coincide
with the times when the nectar is least get-atable, or <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>when the
supply is exhausted for the day; which is another sidelight on
honey-bee economics.</p>
<p>To follow the bees through their honey-harvesting season is to
review nearly the whole year�s natural growth and
life.&nbsp; In southern England the earliest nectar is drawn from
the willows, which come into flower with late March, but hold
back their sweets until the first spate of fine hot weather comes
flooding in the track of the chilly northern gales.&nbsp; Of
willow-honey there may be much or little, according to the
night-temperatures.&nbsp; Generally it goes by fits and
starts.&nbsp; For a day or two here and there the trees may be
crowded with bees, or they may be deserted for weeks
together.&nbsp; Whenever the sun shines, indeed, the trees that
stand up like torches of gold in the misty purple of budding
woods, are always full of the singing multitude; but these are
only the pollen-gatherers.&nbsp; The nectar-bearing willows are
far less showy.&nbsp; Their catkins are small, tight-girt tassels
of green, and when a warm night has brought them into profit,
they attract all the noisy minstrels for miles round.&nbsp;
Bee-keepers generally seem to leave the willows out of their
calculations as a source of honey, but in riverside districts,
and in favourable seasons, they are not to be overlooked.&nbsp;
It sometimes happens that April comes in with a succession of
mild sunny days and warm nights, and then the hives may suddenly
overflow with willow-honey.&nbsp; When the yellow catkins fade
out of sight, the willows are apt to fade out of memory; and it
does not seem to be commonly known that the female catkins
continue to secrete abundant nectar often up to the end of
May.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>Good
honey-years are scarce under the changing English skies; yet
Nature�s design for the hive-people is obviously to give an
unbroken succession of honey-yielding plants throughout the whole
spring and summer, and pollen whenever a bright break of sunshine
may lure them out of doors.&nbsp; The white-clover is seldom
ready until the first week in June; but, from the earliest
willows in March until the last of the flowering seed-crops is
down in late July, there is abundance of provender, if only the
fickle sun will do its part in the matter.&nbsp; The clover, as
farming goes nowadays, is the great main source of honey, in
southern England at least; but the connoisseurs are at variance
as to what yields the absolute perfection of honey.&nbsp;
Scotsmen are all of one mind, for a rare chance, in this; and
will hear of nothing but the heather, carefully discriminating
between the bell-heather, which is good, and the ling-heather,
which is immeasurably better.&nbsp; Yet there is a honey, or
rather a honey-blend, which far outstrips them all, though it is
as rare and almost as priceless as the once famous Comet
vintages.&nbsp; It is to be had only when the apple-blossom and
the hawthorn come into full flower together, and this is only
when a chill April has delayed the one and a summer-like May has
forced on the other.&nbsp; Then, to the mellow refinement of the
apple-nectar, is added the delicate <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>almond flavour of the hawthorn, and
the resulting honey is easily the finest sweetmeat in the
world.</p>
<p>Wonder is often expressed that one of the most generally
cultivated crops, the red-clover, is seldom visited by the
honey-bee, although the bumblebees fill it with their deep
trombone-music at all times of the day.&nbsp; It is true that the
tongue of the hive-bee cannot reach to the bottom of the long
red-clover calyx, but this would not deter her if the nectar were
worth the gathering.&nbsp; She would cut through the petal at its
base, as she does with many other flowers, and so steal an
effective march on her better caparisoned rival.&nbsp; But
red-clover nectar is poor in consistency and coarse of
flavour.&nbsp; When the main crop is in flower, it would yield a
practically unlimited amount of honey, but this is just the time
when the bee can employ herself more profitably elsewhere.&nbsp;
After the red-clover has been cut, a second growth springs up,
bearing flower-tubes less developed, and therefore shorter than
those of the first crop.&nbsp; But now other and better sources
of supply are rapidly failing.&nbsp; The bee�for whom, in
prosperous times, nothing but the best is good enough�must
revise her tastes to meet her necessities.&nbsp; At this time she
is as busy as the rest in the red-clover fields.&nbsp; And when
her clearer, sweeter note is heard there, mingling its contralto
with the hoarser music of the bumblebee, it is a token that the
heyday of the year is past: the honey-chambers must be taken off
the hives without delay.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE DRONE AND HIS STORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is true that all bee-keepers are
enthusiasts, and true that long years spent in the companionship
of the hives invariably create a fearless fellowship, a prime
understanding between the bee-master and his legions.&nbsp; But
it is equally true that the longer you study the nature of the
honey-bee, the less enamoured you become of certain of her
ways.</p>
<p>In the minds of old beemen there grows up, as the years glide,
a sort of awe of her.&nbsp; She is so manifestly a power, supreme
in her little world.&nbsp; She is so courageous, resourceful,
brainy.&nbsp; All the weaknesses and compromises, and most of the
pleasures, have long ago been driven out of her life, seemingly
by her own act and will; yet, in doing this, she has but refined
the science of citizenship to its pure elements.&nbsp; Her entire
unselfishness, her readiness to sacrifice her individual good for
the good of the State, are as unquestionable as they are
changeless.&nbsp; The hive-polity, taken as a whole, is so
admirable, and compares so <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>advantageously with certain human
efforts in the same way, that you are apt to exalt all her
qualities into virtues; and to conclude that a far-seeing, wise
benevolence must have gone to the making of the perfect
Bee-State, instead of the cold, undeviating logic that alone has
fashioned it.</p>
<p>This remorseless smelting-down of life into the set moulds of
principle, without mercy and without reproach, has a cumulative
effect on the mind of the observer; and sooner or later, though
he will early lose his fear of her sting, he will develop a very
real, but vague, awe of the honey-bee in another way.</p>
<p>Just as Moses Rusden, the King�s bee-master, held up the
life of the hive as Nature�s evidence of the Divine will in
earthly monarchy, so the latter-day student is often constrained
to ask himself whether the bee-commonwealth does not point an
authoritative moral in another way.&nbsp; Here is a
State�only a mimic one, but still not a negligible
example�where several of the most fiercely-debated
questions of modern human life are seen in long adopted and
perfected working-order, and seen in their fullness of
result.&nbsp; Any attempt at a serious comparison between men and
women, and the drone and worker-bee, would justly lay the writer
open to the charge of grotesque trifling; but there is more than
a fanciful analogy between the principles on which all
civilisations must be based, whether they are insect or
human.&nbsp; It cannot be <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>denied that the communal life of the
honey-bee is a high civilisation; that it has grown to be what it
is to-day through ages of necessity; that the one sex has the
other under a complete and terrible subjection, for which, and
for the privilege of all power, the dominant sex has paid a
terrible price.</p>
<p>The worker-bee to-day is an over-intellectual, neurotic,
morbidly dutiful creature, while the drone is admittedly nothing
but a stupid, happy, sensual lout.&nbsp; If the extreme
difference between the sexes in bee-life had been aboriginal, the
relations of drone and worker, as we see them in the hives
to-day, would be meet and reasonable enough; but there seems to
be clear evidence that, far back in the life of the race, the
female bee was not so hopelessly superior to her mate.&nbsp; The
queen-bee, in all likelihood, fairly represents the mother-bee as
she was before the cooling crust of the earth made some sort of
protected habitation necessary, which led first to close
clustering for mutual warmth, and then gradually developed the
complicated hive-life of to-day.&nbsp; But evolution will hardly
account for all that we see: revolution must have had its part in
the production of the modern self-unsexed worker.&nbsp; It has
been seen that there is no physiological reason why each worker
in the hive should not have grown into the fertile mother of
thousands.&nbsp; The workers are not a stunted, specialised race,
slowly evolved by time and necessity, and procreating their own
stunted <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>kind; but each worker is deliberately manufactured to a
set pattern by the authorities in the hive, obedient to the call
of the State.&nbsp; And when did the female bees begin this
tampering with the springs of life, this improving upon Creation,
which was the first vital step, failing which the present
bee-commonwealth had been impossible?&nbsp; It looks very like a
superb act of generalship in the great prim�val war of
sex�a brilliant piece of strategy that gave victory at a
blow, and rendered the after-steps in the scheme of conquest a
matter of logical sequence.</p>
<p>The whole question of the artificial production of the
worker-bee is surrounded with difficulties; and it seems
possible, on our present level of knowledge, to do little more
than state the facts, and there leave them.&nbsp; The supremacy
of the females in hive-life appears to have dated from the time
that the vast majority deprived themselves, or were deprived by
their immediate ancestors, of their share in procreation, and the
ovipositor discovered itself as a weapon of offence and
defence.&nbsp; Before the worker-bees existed as an armed force,
there is no reason to suppose that the female bee had a great
physical advantage over the drone.&nbsp; The queen-bee�s
propensity to thrust her ovipositor into the spiracles of her
rival, and so effectually to despatch her, as well as her
inveterate hatred of her kind, may both be late developments, due
to the isolated, artificial life she now leads.&nbsp; While <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>the worker
is ever ready with her sting, the queen uses it so rarely that
many old experienced bee-keepers of the present time deny her
altogether the power of stinging.&nbsp; A much more natural
tendency with her is to bite; and when it comes to the use of the
sharp, strong, sidelong jaws, the drone has a more redoubtable
equipment than any, although he has apparently lost the will and
sense to use it.</p>
<p>Whatever the drone may have been in far-off ages, the
worker-bees have him now well under the iron heel of matriarchal
expediency; and they see to it that he shall be fit only for the
one indispensable office, although in that regard they exhaust
every ingenuity to make him all that his kind should be.&nbsp; It
is plain they would do without him altogether if that were
possible.&nbsp; As it is, for nine months in the year there are
no drones at all, and then only a few hundreds are raised in each
hive�the bare minimum that will ensure the successful
mating of the young queens when the summer sunshine calls them to
their wooing.&nbsp; It might be supposed that where there are
comparatively so few queens to be fertilised�only two or
three at most from each hive, and these only once in a
lifetime�that even those drones which are now tolerated are
in excess of the number required.&nbsp; But a cardinal principle
in bee-life is that the young queens shall choose their mates
from another tribe, and so ensure a continual <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>influx of
new blood to the colony.&nbsp; This can only be effected
out-of-doors, and as far as possible from the parent hive.&nbsp;
The strongest impulse, therefore, of the virgin-queen, when she
goes off on her mating-flight, is to get away quickly from her
home surroundings.&nbsp; She flies straight off at tremendous
speed, and thus has every chance of getting unperceived into new
country, and so into the reconnoitring ground of strange
drones.</p>
<p>Another reason for her extended flight and its remarkable pace
is that only the strongest and swiftest drone of all the pursuing
multitude is likely to overtake her, and this again makes for the
betterment of the race.&nbsp; Perhaps there is no parallel
instance in nature where the selection of the fittest individuals
to continue a species is so carefully provided for, and no doubt
this accounts for the high place of the honey-bee in the scale of
created things.&nbsp; But this scheme involves enormous risk to
the young queen.&nbsp; A hundred dangers lurk on her path.&nbsp;
She is a tempting morsel for every bird that throngs the air of
the June morning.&nbsp; Her untried wings may fail her.&nbsp;
Even if she gets back safely to the bee-garden, she may enter the
wrong hive, to her instant destruction.&nbsp; But she must take
her chance of all risks; and the only thing to do is to render
her absence from home as brief as may be, and her fertilisation
as sure, by making the wandering drone-population large enough to
cover all probable ranges of flight.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>From
the very first the drone is nurtured in a different way from the
worker-bee.&nbsp; The egg is laid in a wider and deeper cell; and
during its first three days of life the drone-larva is fed with
bee-milk, probably of a special kind and certainly of more
generous quantity.&nbsp; After the third day this chyle-food is
reduced, as is the case with the worker-grub; but while the
worker is then given only honey, it is certain that the
drone-larva receives both honey and pollen, and that for a full
day longer.&nbsp; In all, it takes about twenty-four or
twenty-five days to produce the perfect drone-bee, as against an
average twenty-one days for the worker.&nbsp; The queen-bee, as
has been already seen, is developed in much less time than
either, little more than a fortnight elapsing between the time
the egg is laid and the time she is ready to gnaw her way out of
the cell.</p>
<p>After the drone is hatched, it will be another two weeks or so
before he makes his first venture in the open air.&nbsp; All this
time he has the free run of the larder, and steadily gorges
himself on honey when he is not sleeping off the effects of his
surfeit in some snug, out-of-the-way corner of the hive.&nbsp;
But honey is not his only, or even his principal, food.&nbsp;
Throughout his whole life he is constantly fed by the house-bees
with the rich chyle-food given to him as a larva, and it has been
proved that if this is withheld from him for the space of three
days he will die of starvation, even in the <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>midst of
abundant honey.&nbsp; Thus the worker-bees have him completely in
their power.</p>
<p>The first flight of the drones is a stirring event in the
bee-garden.&nbsp; The common sound of the hives goes on
practically the whole year through.&nbsp; Every sunny midday,
when the temperature mounts to 45� or 50�, will see each
hive the centre of a little galaxy of singers: it is only the
volume of the music that varies with the waxing or waning
days.&nbsp; But with the coming of the drones the whole symphony
of the bee-garden abruptly changes.&nbsp; They never move from
their snug indoor quarters until the day is wearing on towards
noon, and then only in the brightest weather.&nbsp; Blundering
aggressively through the crowd of busy foragers, they rise
heavily on the wing, and soon the ordinary note of the garden is
drowned in the new uproar.&nbsp; They seem to come almost
simultaneously from all hives at once.&nbsp; For a minute or two
the rich, hoarse melody holds the air; and then, almost as
suddenly, it dies away, as these roystering ne�er-do-wells
troop off over hill and dale, each to his favourite
hunting-ground.</p>
<p>There is great divergence of opinion as to the limits of
flight of the drone, but probably he goes farther and faster than
any have yet credited.&nbsp; His magnificent stretch and strength
of wing mark him for a flier.&nbsp; He is all brute force and
lusty energy; and it would be strange if, with but one thing to
do in life�to gad about in search of amorous <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>adventure�he could not do it to a purpose.&nbsp;
If a hive of bees be removed to a distance in the height of the
season, some of both workers and drones are sure to find their
way back to the old spot.&nbsp; This has constantly taken place
when hives have been carried no farther than two miles.&nbsp; But
in one case, when the distance was more than twice as much, no
workers were seen round the old hive-station, yet a little
company of drones was winging aimlessly about the tenantless
stool, and there can be little doubt that these belonged to the
removed colony.&nbsp; It is not suggested that they deliberately
travelled all these miles.&nbsp; The chances are that, in their
daily flight, they got so far away from the new station that they
came within the zone of old landmarks, and thus naturally went on
by the long-accustomed ways.</p>
<p>As a typical instance of a sluggard and idler, the drone-bee
has enjoyed a vogue in the preparatory-school books for ages
past.&nbsp; But, whatever his prim�val equipment for
usefulness may have been, it is evident now that he could not
labour if he would.&nbsp; Physically, in all points but that of
muscle, as well as mentally, he has become degraded to the
inferior of the worker-bee in every way.&nbsp; He is destitute of
all those special contrivances with which she is so amply
furnished.&nbsp; He has no baskets for pollen-carrying, nor any
of the ingenious brushes and combs which she uses to scrape the
pollen from herself and others.&nbsp; He has <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>neither
wax-generating organs, nor leg-pincers to deal with wax.&nbsp;
His tongue is too short for honey-getting.&nbsp; His brain is
much smaller than even that of the feeble-minded queen.&nbsp; The
intricate gland-systems, which play so important a role in the
daily life of the worker, are either completely atrophied in the
drone or exist only in an elementary state.&nbsp; While it has
been the communal will of the hive that the worker-bee should
develop an amazing proficiency of mind and body, the same forces
have been steadily at work to degrade the male-bee into a
creature of dependence, gradually training out of him all
initiative and idea, except in the one direction.&nbsp; Just as
in the case of the queen and the worker, drone and worker-bee
seem hardly to belong to the same race.</p>
<p>And yet, for all his frank incapabilities and lack of ideals,
the drone offers, in one respect, a refreshing contrast to his
sour, stern, duty-worshipping sister.&nbsp; He is a life-long,
incorrigible optimist.&nbsp; He fiddles gaily while the city
burns.&nbsp; All his misery and mourning would not serve to
quench a single spark of it; so he eats, drinks, and is merry,
with the intuition of all drones that Nemesis waits on the morrow
with something disagreeable.&nbsp; It is impossible to study his
ways for long without recognising the spirit of rude jollity and
horse-play that thoroughly pervades all he does.&nbsp; In and out
of the hive he blusters, cannoning roughly against all he meets,
and raising his burly, bullying song <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>in the air as a sort of protest
against all this anxious industry going on about him.&nbsp; Once
gone from the neighbourhood of the hive, he seems to keep
incessantly on the wing until hunger prompts him home
again.&nbsp; For no one has ever seen a drone-bee among the
insects that haunt the flowers, nor ever seen him basking on a
sunlit wall or tree-trunk, after the kind of almost every other
winged atom in the universe.</p>
<p>He comes back to the hive with the same noisy, careless
fanfaronade, and is received by the workers with the same sullen
indifference.&nbsp; They give him his fill of bee-milk, linking
tongues with him as he sits up like an overgrown baby, voracious,
clamouring to be fed.&nbsp; They suffer him to swill at the
honey-stores unchecked, but plainly regard him with
contumely.&nbsp; He is a terrible expense to the State, yet a
necessary one.&nbsp; Silently they go about their uncongenial
business of nourishing him�silently, and with an ominous
patience.&nbsp; They grudge him every drop, and, all the more,
urge him to his excesses.&nbsp; It is not for long.&nbsp; The day
of reckoning is near at hand.&nbsp; Already the poppies glow
scarlet on the hill�the poppies that mark the turning-point
of the summer; and after them the long decline, with its
ever-diminishing sun-glow; each day with a scantier meed of
blossom, until the path runs again into the dreary levels, the
sober greys and russets, of winter death.</p>
<p>Now the worker-bee is to show a grizzly seam <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>in her
nature, matching ill with the fine hues and qualities of mind for
which she is so justly famed.&nbsp; And that she is not all
lovable, all admirable, accounts for the exceeding love of her
that moves the hearts of men who know her through and
through.&nbsp; The story of the massacre of the drones has hardly
a parallel for sheer relentless ferocity�unrecking
abandonment to a vengeance long withheld for expediency�s
sake.&nbsp; There come the first chill nights of mid-July, and
the honey-flow is suddenly at an end.&nbsp; The clover and
sainfoin have already fallen to the sickle.&nbsp; Nothing but the
bravest warmth and exuberance of the summer could now withstand
the drain of the myriad honey-makers, and a few hours� cold
dams up at once the attenuated stream.&nbsp; The time of
prosperity is over.&nbsp; There will be no more abundance of
honey.&nbsp; It remains for the genius of hive-economy to prove
how much of what has been gathered can be preserved for future
needs.</p>
<p>The first sign of the <i>d�b�cle</i> is the
throwing out at the hive entrance of certain pale, gruesome
objects�the corpses of immature drones, not dead from
mischance, but ruthlessly torn from their cells.&nbsp; This may
go on intermittently for many days, and while the fell work is
proceeding the living drones seem to take no warning.&nbsp; They
keep up their merry round; the unending feast riots forward;
daily the bee-garden is filled with their careless, overweening
song.&nbsp; And then at last the signal <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>for the
slaughter is given.&nbsp; Within each hive a curious sobbing
outcry begins�a cry that is nothing but sheer terror put
into sound.&nbsp; The drones no longer lie in easy ranks between
the combs, placidly sleeping off one debauch and dreaming of
another.&nbsp; They are all awake now, and fleeing abjectly for
their lives through the narrow ways of the bee-city, the workers
in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>The deep, vibrant, horror-laden note increases hour by
hour.&nbsp; As each executioner overtakes her victim, she grips
him by the base of the wing; and, helped by others all alike
infuriate at the work, she half drags, half pushes him through
the throng, until she has him in the light of day, and tumbles
with him to the ground; he for ever fighting and struggling, and
uttering that frenzied note of fear; she savagely gnawing at the
wing until it is disabled, and he can never more return to the
hive.&nbsp; Many of the strongest drones escape from their
persecutors for the time being, and fly away unhurt.&nbsp; But it
is only for a few hours.&nbsp; Hunger is sure to bring them back
to the hive, when the waiting guards fall upon them, and maim or
drive them off once more.&nbsp; It is specially to be marked that
the bees never sting the drones at this great annual feast of
carnage.&nbsp; There is that much method in the madness which has
seized upon them; for, in the rough-and-tumble of such a
conflict, stings would be plucked out by the <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>roots, and
thus valuable lives would go down with the worthless.&nbsp; The
sole object seems to be to rid the hives as effectively as
possible of the presence of the drones; and the disablement of
one wing appears to be all that is necessary, and therefore all
for which the deft assassin strives.</p>
<p>With some bee-races the massacre of the drones is carried
through in an incredibly short space of time; with others the
agony of the thing is drawn out for days together.&nbsp; The
wretched sires of the hive are caught between two evils, each as
fatal as the other.&nbsp; If they fly off to the fields,
starvation and the night-chills will swiftly bring about their
end.&nbsp; If they return to the hive, a still speedier death
awaits them.&nbsp; Night and day, at this time, the guard-bees
are doubled and re-doubled at the city-gates; and there is little
chance of the wiliest drone outwitting them.&nbsp; But he usually
takes the home-hazard; and sooner or later comes blundering in,
receiving with open arms, as it were, his share of the knife, as
Huddlestone faced the Carbonari.</p>
<p>All this is the common way with the bee-republic, when the
season goes as it should; and the hive is in possession of a
mother-bee�young, strong, and of proved fecundity.&nbsp;
But there are times when the drones�for all their great
expense and drain on the wealth of the colony�are suffered
to live on until the late autumn, or even to remain unmolested
throughout the winter and following <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>spring.&nbsp; If the bee-master sees
drones about a hive, when other colonies have long ago made a
good riddance of them, he well knows what ails the stock.&nbsp;
Its queen is old and failing; and these astute amazons have given
reprieve to their male-kind until a new mother-bee can be raised
and properly mated.&nbsp; It is a case of mercy to the drones
tempered with so much justice to themselves that the original
virtue is largely discounted.</p>
<p>And where the drones are carried through the winter, it is
ever a sign that the hive is not only without a queen, but never
will contrive one, of their own race.&nbsp; Yet they know that,
in the preservation of the drones, they have at least one
indispensable element for their salvation, and�who shall
gainsay it of the sovereign honey-bee?�perhaps they rely on
the bee-master to guess their plight, and furnish them with
another queen, in time to save his property from extinction.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">AFTER THE FEAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the year grows in the
bee-garden, so it goes, with all but imperceptible tread and
tread.&nbsp; In southern England, after the seed-hay is down,
there is little more for the bees to do but prepare their hives
for the coming winter.&nbsp; The queen is slowly weaned from her
absorption in egg-laying by a gradual change in food.&nbsp; Day
by day she receives less of the mysterious bee-milk which was her
urging and inspiration; day after day she finds herself the more
constrained to slake her hunger at the open honey-cells with the
common crowd.&nbsp; Every day sees fewer bee-children born to the
hive, and every day sees more and more of the old
workers�worn out with a short six weeks or so of summer
toil�pass away in that inexplicable fashion, using,
perchance, their last strength of wing to hie them to the
traditional graveyard of their kind.&nbsp; What becomes of them
all, not the wisest among beemen knows; but it is certain that,
as they lived by communal principle, in the same faith they die;
and their last act may be the truly collective one�of
removing their own bodies out of the way of harm to the cherished
State.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>With
the waning months, the population of the hive decreases visibly,
and, as their numbers fail, the temper of the bees suffers just
as evident a change.&nbsp; Old bee-keepers know by sharp
experience that early autumn is a time when vigilance well repays
itself.&nbsp; For all life the season of autumn has its peculiar
tests and trials of character; and this is especially true with
regard to the honey-bee.&nbsp; Each strain of bees has its
proclivities, good or bad, which are sure to come to the front at
this season.&nbsp; And, more than any, bad qualities will show
themselves, now that the rush of the year�s work is over,
and the common energy must take its course through an ever
shallowing and straitening way.</p>
<p>To find rank dishonesty in a creature of so small account in
creation as an insect, is rather startling to old-fashioned
ideas; but it is nevertheless beyond dispute that some stocks of
bees are prone to develop a tendency to housebreaking and robbery
of their neighbour�s goods during early autumn, and, in a
lesser degree, when the first scanty supply of nectar begins in
early spring.</p>
<p>Virgil, and almost all the classic writers, give stirring
accounts of the frequent battles among bees in their day.&nbsp;
We are told of vast conflicts <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>taking place in mid-air, of the
kings leading forth their hosts of warriors�the din of
carnage�the wounded and dying falling like rain out of the
blue of the summer sky.&nbsp; These descriptions have always been
a great puzzle to modern students of bee-life, because nothing of
the kind seems to take place at the present day.&nbsp; Each hive
goes about its business, apparently in complete disregard of the
existence of other hives.&nbsp; Neither at home, nor abroad in
the fields, are reprisals ever witnessed among bees, whether
singly or collectively.&nbsp; The most peaceable creature in the
world is the honey-bee, except in the single case when her home
is being wantonly assailed.</p>
<p>But in autumn frequent encounters take place between
robber-bees and the hive they are attacking, and one is
constrained to believe that it is of this Virgil writes.</p>
<p>Perhaps when once a stock has discovered that stealing honey
is a much quicker and easier method of obtaining it than by the
laborious process of gathering, these particular bees will never
again be won back to honest courses.&nbsp; Not only will the
parent hive continue to break out in this way at the close of
every season, but all swarms from the same hive are certain to
develop the like tendencies.&nbsp; The strain will be a continual
source of annoyance and loss to the bee-master, and, if he be
wise, he will take the shortest and surest way of putting an end
to the trouble, by promptly <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>changing the queen, and thus in the
end exterminating the original stock.&nbsp; Where this is in his
own garden, there will be no difficulty in the matter; but often
the robbers are wild bees, brigands inhabiting a hollow tree in
some neighbouring wood, and making sudden raids upon their
law-abiding neighbours in adjacent villages, after the manner of
brigands all the world over.&nbsp; The strangers have often a
peculiar appearance, which singles them out immediately from the
legitimate members of the gardens.&nbsp; They are darker in
colour and shinier; and they have a bold, yet furtive, way of
getting about, which suggests at once the prowling marauder.</p>
<p>Wandering among the hives on a fine September morning, several
of these light-fingered, sinister folk may be seen hovering about
the entrance to a hive, or trying to creep in unobserved.&nbsp;
Their presence is promptly detected, and a sudden hubbub arises
as the guard-bees set upon the intruders and drive them
off.&nbsp; There is no doubt of their intention.&nbsp; They are
spies from the robber camp, and their object is to discover those
hives which are weak in population, and so will fall the easier
prey to the depredators when in force.&nbsp; Strong stocks have
little to fear from robbers; they can always hold their own
against attack, and therefore are seldom molested.</p>
<p>These scouts disappear for a time, and the hive settles down
to its wonted, busy tranquillity.&nbsp; But <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>soon a
little blur of bees may be seen coming over the hedge-top, and
making straight for the selected hive.&nbsp; There is no more
crafty reconnoitring.&nbsp; It is to be battle undisguised.&nbsp;
The robbers descend upon their prey, and at once a terrific
uproar begins, a desperate hand-to-hand fight between besiegers
and besieged.&nbsp; Left to themselves, the weak stock will have
little chance from the outset.&nbsp; It is quickly
overcome.&nbsp; And then a curious thing often happens.&nbsp; The
bees of the home-colony which have survived the fight, join
forces with the victors, and themselves help to rifle and carry
away to the robbers� lair the treasure which is their own
by right.&nbsp; Luckily, the bee-master has an all but unfailing
preventive of this vexatious trouble ready to his hand.&nbsp; He
can safely leave all those hives which are numerically strong of
citizens to take care of themselves, and those which are weak of
population he can join together in twos or threes, converting
them also into strong, self-protective colonies.&nbsp; The modern
movable-comb hive is a power in the hands of the capable beeman,
for the comb-frames from several hives can be placed together in
one, and the bees will unite quite peaceably at this season, if
all are well dusted with a flour-dredger, or treated with a
scent-spray, so that in odour and appearance they may be
alike.&nbsp; Probably every hive has its own distinct odour,
which is shared by all its denizens, and this is no doubt the
means by which the <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>sentinel bees at the entrance recognise their own
comrades, while they promptly fall upon all interloping
strangers.</p>
<p>The preparation of the hive for the winter is of a piece with
all else that the bee undertakes.&nbsp; As the area of the
brood-nest shrinks, the empty cells are filled with honey, this
being brought down from the store-cells farthest away.&nbsp; The
foragers keep steadily at work whenever the weather holds,
gathering up the remnants of the feast and bringing them home to
swell the winter-larder.&nbsp; Where there is much ivy, a fine
October will often see the hives as busy again as ever they were
in the bravest days of June; but the throng of bees is manifestly
smaller.&nbsp; The rich song of life begins later in the day, and
lasts only during the brightest hours; and that wonderful
night-sound, the deep underground thunder of the fanning bees, is
gone from the bee-garden, just as the scent of the clover-nectar,
brewing and steaming in the hives, no longer drifts across in the
darkness, filling the bee-master�s house with the fragrance
he loves more than all else in the world.</p>
<p>The old ragged-winged bees, that have stood the brunt of the
season, are now, too, nearly all gone.&nbsp; The hives are filled
with bees of the same race, inspired by the same traditions; but
they are at the beginning of life, the raw recruits of destiny, a
mere stop-gap crew.&nbsp; They have no memories of the time when
work was a fever, a tumultuous <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>race with the sun, in which the
swiftest must lag behind.&nbsp; They have never known the
over-weighty cargoes, the bursting honey-sacs, and
pollen-panniers so laden that they could be scarce dragged into
the hive, and they will never know them.&nbsp; These bees, born
late in the season, have their lot cast in the torpid backwaters
of their little world.&nbsp; Theirs is to be but a dreary eking
out of days, so that they may have strength enough to warm the
first spring broods into life.&nbsp; The few hot days that burn
in the midst of the snows of each English
March�immeasurably far off now, and unattainable,
seemingly�will be all they will ever see of the power of
sunshine.&nbsp; Winter bees are born to the prison-house; and in
it, and for it, live and die.</p>
<p>At the most, a worker-bee sees but six months of life: at the
least�and this is the lot of many�she withstands the
incessant wear and tear of her hard calling for six, or possibly
eight, weeks.&nbsp; Thus, though the hive may be always packed
with citizens, the population is for ever changing.&nbsp; Half a
dozen times in the year, perhaps, and for a score of years, you
may go to your bee-garden, and each time move among tens of
thousands to whom you are an utter stranger, and whom you have
never seen before.&nbsp; And yet, in all its customs, its
propensities, its traditions, the life of the bees is Continuity
impersonified.&nbsp; You may go round the world, and spend ten
years on the journey; and, <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>coming back to the old leafy nook of
the country, find the old green hive still in its corner under
the lilac, still the centre of what seems the same crowd of
winged merchant-women sailing home under the same gay colours,
singing the old glad songs, building the old wondrous fabrics in
the darkness, transmuting the same fragrant essences into the
same elixir of gold.&nbsp; And what is this mysterious thing
called the Bee-Commonwealth, which is alone immortal, while all
that composes it, and pertains to it, and upholds it, passes and
dies?</p>
<p>You must not forget the queen-bee here.&nbsp; She alone, it
must be remembered, persists year in and year out, while
generation after generation of her children grow up and die about
her�a hundred thousand of them, may-be, in each
twelve-month, thousands even between one single summer dawn and
the dusk of the western sky.&nbsp; Methuselah of old, on the more
moderate human scale, must have had some such
experience�must have divined the broader plan of life from
the incessant repetitions of chance and change that passed before
him.&nbsp; The power to generalise into symbols comes only to the
ancient of days; and he of all men had learnt to fathom, to
estimate, to winnow out the sober drab grain from the glittering,
rainbow chaff of life.&nbsp; Over and over again he must have
kept the true true to itself with one wise word, and turned back
the false, dazzled and discomfited, with one flash from his
mirror of the ages.&nbsp; He <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>was a living history-book, where all
men might read the common drift and outcome of life; and as a
record of the hive�s story, a living archive for its plans,
its systems, its ideals, the mother-bee may exist to
day�she who, in comparison with its ever coming and going
thousands, is an age-old, imperishable thing.</p>
<p>And so you may think of her, in the short days of December
twilight, or in the interminable night-darkness full of the
raging of the winter wind, gathering her children about her, and
telling them tales of their forbears� prowess; teaching
them old bee-songs which have but the one refrain of work and
winning; and never forgetting her own little story�of the
one brief hour of her love-flight and marriage, bought and paid
for by widowhood lasting her whole life.</p>

257</span>CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="GutSmall">THE MODERN BEE-FARM</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well enough to consider the
scientific side of hive-life for its intrinsic interest, to treat
it for what it really is�one of the most absorbing studies
available for leisure hours.&nbsp; But the honey-bee is something
more than a wonder-maker, or a peg on which to hang dilettante
moralisms.&nbsp; Rightly treated and exactly understood, she can
be made of great use in the world.</p>
<p>There are two things in this England of ours which profoundly
astonish all who love bees, and have a true conception of their
possibilities.&nbsp; Travel where you may in the land, the last
thing you are likely to meet with is a bee-farm, or even a few
hives in a cottage-garden; while every yard of your way has its
nook of blossom, and every mile its stretch of flowery pasture,
where, in sober truth, tons of honey are annually running to
waste.&nbsp; All this could be garnered and sold to the people at
little trouble and great profit, if only enterprise would wake up
from its island-lethargy and stretch forth the hand.&nbsp; But
the years dribble uselessly <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>by, and nothing is done.&nbsp; Here
and there a wide-awake husbandman gets a little township of hives
together, sells in the neighbourhood all the honey his bees make,
and puts to his pocket a gold and silver lining.&nbsp; But this
is only a drop in the ocean, and the British people must send
abroad for their honey, which they do to the pretty tune of more
than �30,000 a year.</p>
<p>Hitherto, reasoning backward from effect to cause, it would
seem that farming has been remunerative only when undertaken on a
large scale; but those who can read the signs of the times tell
us that the age, just dawning to the country-side, will be the
age of the small man.&nbsp; And this must mean that the
hereditary aristocracy among crops�wheat, oats,
barley�will slowly give place to little-culture: in a word,
that the land will be made to produce, not the things that
tradition and our yeoman family pride have ordained as the be-all
and end-all of farming, but the minor, humble necessities for
which each town and village should look to the good brown earth
immediately about it, but at present looks in vain.&nbsp;
Farmers� ladies may then no longer sit in their
drawing-rooms and ride in their carriages, but that will be a
change for the simpler, more proportionate.&nbsp; Those who live
in towns have little conception of it; but the country-dweller
knows well what complexity and luxury have got into the old
English farmhouses, for all the outcry about hard times; how the
farmer�s <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>wife no longer goes to her dairy, nor makes any of the
good old farmhouse things that served to uphold country England
in days gone by; and how the master-agriculturists now are the
sinews of the great London Stores, while the little local
shopkeepers are left to the field-labourer with his twelve or
fifteen shillings a week.</p>
<p>For the class of small-holders that must now multiply
throughout the length and breadth of the land, there is awaiting
an enterprise�a source of livelihood�as yet hardly
tapped.&nbsp; A stock subject of envy with most artisans is the
capitalist who leads an easy life while his factory hands toil
for him.&nbsp; But if the small-holder will take up bee-keeping,
he too can look on, to a large extent, while his thousands of
winged labourers are filling his storehouse with some of the most
useful and saleable merchandise in the world.&nbsp; It is a
truism in commerce that a good supply creates a demand just as
certainly as that the universal want of a thing stimulates its
production.&nbsp; One of the needs in England to-day is a full,
good, and cheap supply of honey; and when this is forthcoming
there will be little fear but that the present demand will
increase hand over hand.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why the people should choose honey for
their principal food rather than the beet sugar which is now so
largely consumed.&nbsp; In the first place, honey is a pure,
natural, undoctored sweet, while in the manufacture of <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>ordinary
sugar the use of more or less noxious chemicals seems to be
indispensable.&nbsp; When a stock of bees must be artificially
fed, and common grocers� sugar is used for the purpose, the
result is generally that half the stock is poisoned by the
chemicals with which the sugar has been treated at the
mill.&nbsp; And if this is its effect on bees, the inference must
be that it cannot prove altogether wholesome for men.&nbsp; But
its purity is not the chief reason why honey should be the
universal sweet-food of the people.&nbsp; Honey is the ordinary
sugar of nectar concentrated and converted into what is
chemically known as grape-sugar; and thus, in ripe honey, the
first and most important part of digestion is already effected
before it leaves the comb.&nbsp; This explains why so many
delicate people, and particularly children, can assimilate food
sweetened with honey, when they can take no other form of
sweet.</p>
<p>Doctors are continually finding some new virtue in
honey.&nbsp; Its gently regulating action has been long known,
and there is good authority for stating that there is not an
organ in the human body which does not benefit from its habitual
use.&nbsp; In all wasting diseases, and triumphantly in
consumption, it will prevail as an up-builder when everything
else fails.&nbsp; There is no doubt at all that cases of
consumption have been entirely cured by a liberal diet of honey;
and, notoriously, honey is the main ingredient in nearly all
patent medicines <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>for diseases of the chest and throat.&nbsp; Therapeutic
hints from laymen are generally looked upon askance by medical
men�at least, by those of the old-fashioned type; yet, on
the chance that this page may come under the eye of some of the
more elastic-minded, the thing may be hazarded.&nbsp; There are
many who believe in it, and with good reason, as a sovereign
specific where the disease is a wasting one.&nbsp; It is nothing
else than the once famous Athole Brose, which, as all Scottish
bee-keepers know, consist of equal parts of good thick honey,
preferably from ling-heather, and of cream, and of mature Scotch
whisky from the pot-still.&nbsp; Little and often is the rule for
its administration, but, unlike most old wife�s remedies,
faith has nothing to do with its wonder-working.&nbsp; Scepticism
is a soil in which it seems to flourish as well as any.</p>
<p>The man of business, resolved to take up bee-keeping as a
livelihood, must, at the outset, decide on what scale he will
carry the matter through.&nbsp; There are two aspects of the
thing, each more alluring than the other, according to the
temperament and point of view.&nbsp; There is the Simple Life and
the bee-garden�a life spent in the green quiet of an
English village, within reach of a market town, where the produce
of the hives may be disposed of.&nbsp; And there is the greater
enterprise, the foundation of a bee-farm on an extensive scale,
and on the most approved scientific principles, where the object
is to supply the <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>great central markets at a distance rather than the
immediate local needs.</p>
<p>In the establishment of a bee-farm the first care must be the
choice of a suitable district.&nbsp; The nature of the
surrounding country must largely govern the systems on which the
farm can be most profitably worked.&nbsp; The first maxim in
successful beemanship is to get all hives filled to the brim with
worker-bees by the time the great honey-flow sets in.&nbsp; This
time, however, varies according to the district.&nbsp; In the
orchard-country we need bees early; in heather-districts we want
them late.&nbsp; In south-west England, where the country is half
fruit-ground and half moorland, the hives must be huge in
population both late and early.&nbsp; But where the bee-keeper
follows the sheep-farmer�and there is no better guide to
honey than the sheep�his true policy is to work his
colonies slowly and steadily up to their greatest strength by the
time the main feed-crops come into blossom, which is seldom
before the middle of May.&nbsp; And all these considerations land
us on the brink of a very vexed question in modern
bee-craft�whether bees should be artificially fed, and if
so, how and when?</p>
<p>If only the purest cane-sugar is used, and the syrup well
boiled and never burnt, there is nothing to say against the
practice on the score of harm to the stocks.&nbsp; Where early
bees are wanted, it is absolutely necessary to give them a
continuous <a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>supply of sugar-syrup from the first moment that
breeding commences in the hives.&nbsp; Chemically, the sweet
constituent in nectar is almost identical with that from the
sugar-cane; and sugar-syrup has this advantage over honey
given�that it more nearly simulates the natural flow.&nbsp;
The bees responsible for the nursery-work in the hive and the
regulation of the queen�s fecundity, are young bees that
have never yet flown.&nbsp; They can, therefore, only judge of
the progress of the season by the amount of nectar and pollen
coming into the hive.&nbsp; Where this is steadily increasing day
by day�and it is this regular natural progress in
prosperity which the bee-keeper must strive to imitate in
artificial feeding�the nurse-bees gain confidence, and
brood-raising forges rapidly ahead.</p>
<p>But sugar-syrup and pea-flour are not natural foods for bees,
and there is little doubt that a prolonged course of such diet
tends to lower the tone and stamina of the race, and thus may
prepare the way for disease.&nbsp; The golden rule in the matter
seems to be that artificial feeding should be resorted to only
where strength of stocks is necessary, to secure the harvest, or
where actual starvation threatens.&nbsp; In purely
heather-districts, when the big population is quite early enough
if it is to hand in late June, nothing short of imminent
starvation should induce the bee-master to give artificial, and
therefore unavoidably inferior, food.&nbsp; In sheep-country the
same rule holds.&nbsp; Except in <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>the most unfavourable years, a hive,
headed by a young and vigorous queen, can be relied upon to get
itself into the finest fettle by the time the main crops are
ready for exploitation.&nbsp; In this case the beeman has only to
make certain from time to time that no stock is in absolute want
of the ordinary means of subsistence.</p>
<p>But in those warm, favoured regions of the south-west, the
lands of the apple-blossom and the heather, where there is a very
early and a very late harvest to be gathered, a different system
must be pursued.&nbsp; Here we touch on the second grand
principle of successful bee-keeping�the necessity for
having in all hives only the most prolific mother-bees.&nbsp; For
profitable honey-getting a queen should seldom be kept beyond her
second year.&nbsp; After that she is usually of little account,
and should be superseded, either by the bee-master or the
bees.&nbsp; But where a queen has been over-stimulated by feeding
to raise an immense population in the spring of the year, she is
rarely capable of another supreme effort in the autumn.&nbsp; The
best policy, therefore, if the heather-harvest is an important
one, is to remove the old queens as soon as the spring work is
over, and to substitute for them queens that are in their best
season, but at the beginning of their resources instead of at the
end.&nbsp; In this way another huge army of workers is soon born
to the hive, and the double harvest is secured.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>On
the question of the best hive to use in commercial bee-keeping,
on either a large or small scale, it is hard to
particularise.&nbsp; Generalisation, however, is not difficult
here.&nbsp; Every bee-master has his own ideas as to details, but
all are happily agreed on the main constructive principles.&nbsp;
Experience has fairly well decided that a good queen, under the
modern system of intensive culture, will require for her brood a
comb-surface of about 1,800 square inches.&nbsp; A brood-nest of
smaller capacity than this is liable to cramp her operations at
their highest, and anything in excess of it will simply mean so
much new honey lost to the super-chambers, where alone the
bee-master requires it.&nbsp; Honey stored in the brood-nest,
except during the off-season, is loss instead of gain.&nbsp; The
best hive, therefore, will contain just as many brood-combs in
movable frames as will ensure the right capacity; and all
comb-frames throughout the bee-farm must be of the same size, so
that they will be strictly interchangeable among the various
hives.&nbsp; This is a vital point in successful bee-culture,
because it enables the master not only to equalise the strength
of his stocks by transferring combs of hatching brood from one to
the other; but he can also give to penurious stocks frames of
sealed honey from the abundance of their neighbours, and he can
unite the weak colonies, thus rendering all strong.</p>
<p>For the rest, the hives must be so made that heat will be
perfectly retained in the cold season, <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>and as
perfectly excluded during the sultriest time of year.&nbsp;
Double walls round the brood-chamber are a necessity in the
changeable British climate, where chilly days are always probable
during ten months out of the twelve.</p>
<p>As well as honey-production, the bee-farmer will find an equal
source of profit in the production of wax.&nbsp; Just as there is
nothing like leather, beeswax holds its own as a marketable
commodity in spite of paraffin substitutes.&nbsp; But if it is
almost universally degraded by adulteration, the fault lies with
the beemen, who have never seriously attempted to meet the demand
for it.&nbsp; Wax-production on a large scale is perfectly
feasible, and there is little doubt that it could be developed
into an important British industry, as it used to be in
medi�val days.&nbsp; Yet these are times of revolution: the
honey-bee may yet find herself entirely restored to her old
national avocation�of bringing light to our darkness, and
to our bodies one of the best and purest of foods.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">BEE-KEEPING AND THE SIMPLE
LIFE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a quality of English sunshine
that it comes and goes capriciously, so that no man may be sure
of the comradeship of his shadow from day to day.&nbsp; But when
there is sunshine in England, it always seems an abiding,
permanent force.&nbsp; The grey of yesterday, and the patter-song
of the rain on the leaves, were only a dream.&nbsp; You were
sleeping under the changeless blue of a summer night, and had but
a vision of weeping, drab skies, gone now with the joy that comes
in the morning.&nbsp; And to-morrow, when perhaps the old wild
scurry of storm-cloud is alive overhead, and all the house
resounds with the runnel-music from the pouring eaves, still it
will be only a dream.&nbsp; Of a surety you will tell yourself
so, as the sun breaks through the griddle of cloud, and the wind
relents, and the Dutchman can get to his tailoring; and when you
are stepping out amidst the swamp and glitter and rehabilitation
of life, as glad of it all as the finches and butterflies that
sweep on before you down the lane.&nbsp; The <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>sun shines:
you know it has always shone, changeless as Time itself.</p>
<p>With such a faith�unfounded and therefore
uncontestable�I came under the glow of one brave June
morning, threading field after field of blossoming clover until I
stood at the gate of the bee-garden over against the hill.&nbsp;
With its name I had long been familiar, for in the county paper
there was always the little five-line advertisement, quaintly
worded, announcing honey for sale.&nbsp; But I had never yet seen
it, nor, indeed, ever set foot in this part of the good Sussex
land.&nbsp; So, on this brimming June morning, giving rein for
once to the indolent Shank�s mare of moods that is fated to
carry me, I set out into the bright sloth, the joyous
hastelessness, of the day; and came at length to my
destination�to the bee-garden that nestles under the green
Downland hills.</p>
<p>It was girt about with a tall hedge of hawthorn, smothered in
snowlike blossom, with just that rosy tinge upon it which is the
first hectic of decay.&nbsp; Beyond the hedge I could see,
stretching aloft, green apple-boughs, whose full-blown posies
were alive with the desperate humming energy of countless
bees.&nbsp; There was a blue wisp of smoke trailing idly away
from a chimney-stack, all that could be seen of the snug thatched
cottage within; and there were voices, a leisurely baritone, a
sudden peal of laughter high-pitched and obviously a
woman�s, and now and then a bar or two of an <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>old song
sung in an intermittent, absent-minded way.</p>
<p>In one of the pauses of this song, I raised the latch of the
gate.&nbsp; Its sharp click drew to its full lean height a figure
at the end of the garden, which was bending down in the midst of
a wilderness of hives.&nbsp; As the man came towards me coatless,
his rolled-up shirt-sleeves baring wiry brown arms to the hot
June sun, I took in all the busy, quiet picture.&nbsp; The
red-tiled, winding path, the sea of old-fashioned garden-flowers
on every hand, billows of lilac and red-may and laburnum, shadowy
blue deeps of forget-me-not, scarlet tulips amidst them like
lighthouses, and drifting shallows of amber mignonette.&nbsp; A
decent house stood hard by, its windows bright and clean as
diamond-facets.&nbsp; There was a gay flicker of linen on a line
beyond.&nbsp; An old dog lolled in a straw-filled barrel.&nbsp; A
cat kept company with a milk jug on the spotless doorstep.&nbsp;
And everywhere there were beehives, each of a different
harmonious shade of colour, not ranged in stilted rows, but
scattered here and there in twos and threes in the orderless
order beloved of bees and unsuburban men.</p>
<p>The bee-master had keen grey eyes, set deep in a
sun-blackened, honest face, and the ever-ready tongue of him was
that of the beeman all the world over.&nbsp; He was ripe and
willing to talk of his work, explaining what he was, and what he
had done, as we slowly wandered through his <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>domain.&nbsp; He was a Londoner�he told
me�at least, that was his fate half a dozen years
ago�a City clerk, pale as the ledger-leaves that fluttered
through his fingers from nine to six of the working day.&nbsp;
And at home, in a dreary desert of housetops called
Nunhead�whither may an unkind fate never lure me�his
sisters sewed for a living, white-faced as himself.&nbsp; But one
day, in an old second-hand book-shop, he lit upon a threepenny
treasure�a book on the management of bees.&nbsp; He read it
as his train crawled homeward on one stifling, freezing,
fog-bound winter�s night; and there and then, in the mean,
dirty cattle-box of a third-class carriage, in fancy the
bee-garden was inaugurated, that has since developed into all I
saw around me on that brave morning in June.</p>
<p>It was a long time in the doing, he told me, as we sauntered
among the busy hives, speaking with a delightful Sussex
intonation already veneered upon his Cockney brogue�a long
and weary and scraping time.&nbsp; There was money to be saved,
the capital needed for the enterprise; and this was no easy
matter out of a total family income of forty shillings a
week.&nbsp; But at last it was done, and well done.&nbsp; There
came a day when the three of them shook the dust of Nunhead from
their feet, and took over possession of the little tumbledown
cottage with its bare half-acre of neglected ground.&nbsp; Well,
those were hard times to begin with�he said, with an
unaccountable relish in the <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>recollection;�but now, look
how all was changed!&nbsp; He waved a triumphant, proudly
proprietary arm around him.&nbsp; The cottage was sound and well
furnished throughout.&nbsp; The three or four bought hives, with
which he had started his business, had multiplied into sixty or
seventy, all made by his own hands.&nbsp; Where had he got the
bees?&nbsp; Well, that threepenny book had taught him a
secret�the art of bee-driving.&nbsp; Nearly all the
cottagers for miles round were in the habit of sulphuring their
bees to get at the honey.&nbsp; The first autumn, and every
autumn since then, he had gone to his neighbours and told them he
would take the bees out of the hives for them, and leave them all
the combs and a good trink-geld into the bargain, if they would
let him have the bees for his trouble.&nbsp; And they were more
than willing.&nbsp; And thus he had gradually built up his little
principality of hives.</p>
<p>But, the profit of the thing?&nbsp; This, indeed, was nothing
much to boast of.&nbsp; He sold all the honey and wax he got,
sending it away, for the most part, by post, and extending the
circle of his custom by little and little with every year.&nbsp;
Taking the bad years with the good, he had made a net return of
�2 for every hive; in bumper-seasons it was always much
more.&nbsp; It was not a great deal, but there were only three of
them, and their wants were simple.&nbsp; Their greatest
needs�fresh air, peace, and quiet, the healthful life of
the <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>country�these were to be had for nothing at
all.&nbsp; And as for clothes�you never know, until you
give over trying to keep up appearances, how very little
appearances count in the world.&nbsp; At any rate, for them, the
whole thing was a complete success.&nbsp; There were men round
about that country-side who farmed whole provinces, and still
grumbled; but here was he, getting peace and plenty from half an
acre; and as for the girls, they did nothing but laugh and sing
all day long.</p>
<p>Thus we wandered and talked; and I�feigning ignorance of
bee-matters, lest he might think I was but carrying coals to
Newcastle in clumsy charity�bought honey, and asked many
questions; and slowly the entire meaning of what had been done by
these emancipated slaves of City clerkdom was revealed.&nbsp; The
bee-master pushed his old straw hat back over his clever
forehead, and lit the most comfortable pipe I had ever set eyes
on.&nbsp; He had evidently thought the whole thing out long ago,
and got it down to its essential elements.</p>

<p>�What we are doing here,� he said, �could be
done by hundreds of others who are still in London in what was
once our old plight.&nbsp; Large bee-farms are all very well, but
they are more or less a thing of the future�something that
is still to be evolved out of twentieth-century needs.&nbsp; But
the bee-garden has its immediate use and place in every district
where there is an average population.&nbsp; <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>People
generally have got out of the habit of eating honey because it is
so seldom on sale in the shops; but if you steadily and
continuously remind them of it, they will buy, and soon grow to
wonder how they did without it for so long.&nbsp; But it must be
set before them in an attractive way.&nbsp; Run-honey must be
bright and pure to look at, and neatly bottled and
labelled.&nbsp; If you sell honey in the comb, the section-boxes
must be spotlessly clean and white.&nbsp; In that old book that
first led me to bee-keeping, it says that only the English bee
should be kept, because it is a better honey-gatherer.&nbsp; But,
from the salesman�s point of view, there is a much more
weighty reason for abjuring all foreign strains of bees.&nbsp;
English bees leave a thin film of air between the honey and the
cell cappings, and the result is that the comb always looks
perfectly white.&nbsp; But nearly all foreigners fill their cells
to the brim, and this means that the finest honeycomb will have a
dark and dirty appearance, and no one will be tempted to
buy.&nbsp; That is the sort of thing a business-man thinks of
first, so the old training days in London have not been
altogether without their use even here.�</p>
<p>The song, aloof and desultory, that I had heard from the
garden-gate, was growing clearer as we walked; and now we turned
the house-corner, and came upon more hives, with a neat, girlish
figure busy among them; and, hard by, a tiny laundry-shed,
wherein I caught a glimpse of brown arms <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>deep in a
wash-tub, and heard the last stanza of the vagulous song.</p>
<p>�Hetty, there,� explained the bee-master,
�helps in the garden, and�&nbsp; Helps, did I
say?&nbsp; Why, she is far and away a better hand at it than
I.&nbsp; There is so much in hive-work that needs the light touch
which only a woman can give.&nbsp; And Deborah, she keeps house
for us.&nbsp; Did you know that the word Deborah was Hebrew for a
honey-bee?&nbsp; But come and see where I make the hives on
winter days, and where we sling the honey, and fill the
super-crates with the sections, and all the rest of
it.�</p>
<p>He showed me then his workshop and a little gauze-windowed
shed where there was a homemade honey-extractor�a cunning,
centrifugal thing by which the combs could be emptied and
restored unbroken to the bees, to be charged again and
again.&nbsp; And there was a storehouse, where long rows of
honey-jars, and stacks of sections, and blocks of pale yellow wax
were waiting for the purchaser, and a packing-shed where the
postboxes of corrugated cardboard were made up.&nbsp; Finally
there was pointed out to me, in a far-off corner of the garden, a
donkey�shaggy, well-fed, placidly browsing�and, under
a neighbouring pent-roof, a little cart that was a curiosity in
its way.&nbsp; Its wooden tilt was made to represent a big
beehive, and on it was painted the name of the bee-garden and a
list of hive-products which it <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>carried for sale.&nbsp; The
bee-master put an admiring hand upon it.</p>
<p>�It was all Hetty�s idea,� he said.&nbsp;
�London girls for pluck, you know!&nbsp; And she goes into
the town with it once a fortnight in the season; takes it away
crammed full, mind, and never brings back an ounce!&nbsp; Somehow
or other, I think those girls ought to change names!�</p>

<p>Journeying back to the railroad-station under the eternal
English sunshine and through the chain of blossoming fields, I
listened to the chant of the bees around me; and though it was
the familiar sound of a lifetime, there was something in it then
which I had never heard before.&nbsp; The rich note rose and
fell; died down to silence as the path led through impregnable
red-clover; swelled again as the land paled to the rosy hue of
the sainfoin; burst out into a loud, glad symphony where a patch
of charlock blent its despised, uncoveted gold with the
farmer�s drill.&nbsp; �You thought you knew our ways
of life from Alpha to Omega��so seemed to run, in
fancy, the wavering refrain.&nbsp; �You have pried upon us
day and night, in season and out of season.&nbsp; You have
chloroformed us, vivisected us, torn our dead sisters limb from
limb to feed the cruel, glittering eyes of that binocular of
yours.&nbsp; You have come at last to think that there was
nothing about us, within or without or round about, that you had
not got to know.&nbsp; And here a common <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>City clerk,
turned tail on his hereditary duty, has shown you, in one short
hour, a whole sheaf of things about us which you�Peeping
Tom that you are!�in a whole life�s keyhole-prying
have never guessed.&nbsp; Out upon you!&nbsp; You deserve to have
to do with nothing better than bumble-bees for the rest of your
days!�</p>
<p>For the more I thought of little bee-gardens, such as the one
I had just visited, established here, there, and everywhere
throughout the land, the plainer it became that this, after all,
was a mission for the honey-bee that had quite escaped me; and
the fonder of the idea I grew.&nbsp; With bee-keeping on a grand
scale there was the difficulty that an apiary might become too
large for the resources of the country about it, although it is
all but certain that crops grown specially for bees can be made
to pay.&nbsp; But a small garden could never exhaust the land
within its necessary three-mile radius, and all the nectar its
bees could gather would be obtained free.&nbsp; Nunhead has done
it gloriously, thought I, tramping steadily onward through the
clover.&nbsp; And why not all the other Nunheads that hem in the
great cities?&nbsp; There must be plenty who love the dust and
din, and are willing to stop there; so the little band of
bee-gardeners will never be missed.</p>
<p>And there was something else I thought of, too, as I strode
along under the English sunshine which lasts for ever, swinging
my box of superfluous, yet much-prized honey as I went.</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>The
song and that pleasant ripple of laughter�they were in my
ears still, and mingling with the labour-song of the wayside
bees.&nbsp; Now, only a dozen miles or so, away over the
hill-tops in the blue Sussex weald, I knew of just such another
bee-garden, where two brothers�not Londoners this time, but
true-born Downland lads�had well established themselves,
were getting comfortably off, but were still single men.&nbsp;
And only a week ago they had deplored this fact to me,
and�&nbsp; But avast!&nbsp; Match-making was never yet to
be reckoned part of the Lore of the Honey-Bee.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
